<title>HostInfo Task</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2><a name="hostinfo">HostInfo</a></h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sets the <code>NAME</code>, <code>DOMAIN</code>, <code>ADDR4</code>, and <code>ADDR6</code>
properties in the current project.</p>
<p>
The <code>NAME</code> contains the host part of the canonical name of the host.<br/>
If the host is not found, the host will contain the name as provided to the task,
or <code>localhost</code> if no host was provided, and no name for the local
host was found.<br/>
The <code>DOMAIN</code> contains the domain part of the canonical name of the host.<br/>
 If the host is not found, the domain will contain the domain as provided to the task,
 or <code>localdomain</code> if no host / domain was provided.<br/>
The <code>ADDR4</code> contains the IPv4 address of the host with the widest meaning.<br/>
If no IPv4 address is found and a host has been provided the address <code>0.0.0.0</code> 
is returned, when no host was provided the address <code>127.0.0.1</code> is returned.<br/>
The <code>ADDR6</code> contains the IPv6 address of the host with the widest meaning.<br/> 
If no IPv6 address is found and a host has been provided the address <code>::</code> 
is returned, when no host was provided the address <code>::1</code> is returned.<br/>
</p>

<p>These properties can be used in the build-file, for instance, to create
host-stamped filenames, or used to replace placeholder tags inside documents
to indicate, for example, the host where the build was performed on.
The best place for this task is probably in an initialization target.</p>
