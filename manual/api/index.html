<b>Apache Ant API has not been generated</b>

<p>If you see this page online at <a
href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant.apache.org</a>, it is not a bug, but
on purpose.  We do not provide an online version of the API docs, they
are included with all our distributions.</p>

<p align="left">Ant's manual and API documentation is part of
  the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">binary</a>
  distributions or available as a
  separate <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manualdownload.cgi">archive</a>.
