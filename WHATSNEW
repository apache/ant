Changes from Ant 1.5.2 to Ant 1.5.3
===================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------

* The <zip> task and friends have again changed a method signature
  (sorry, was necessary to fix bug 17780).  The return type of
  getResourcesToAdd has changed.

Fixed bugs:
-----------

* <zipfileset>'s filemode would get ignored and the dirmode was used
  for the included files as well.  As a side effect, WinZIP was unable
  to extract or display the files, so they seemed to be missing from
  the archive.  Bugzilla Report 17648.

* <ftp> could use the wrong path separator when trying to change the
  remote working directory.  Bugzilla Report 17735.

* <jar update="true"> would loose all original files if you didn't
  specify any nested <(zip)fileset>s and the manifest had changed.
  Bugzilla Report 17780.

* If you used a value starting with \ on Windows for the appxml
  attribute of <ear> or the webxml attribute of <war>, it would be
  ignored.  Bugzilla Report 17871.

* Ant will no longer implicitly add Sun's rt.jar in <javac> when you
  use jvc and don't specify a bootclasspath.  Bugzilla Report 18055.
  
* The prefix attribute of <zipfileset> would not generate directory
  entries for the prefix itself.  Bugzilla Report 18403.

* starteam checkout can now handle deleted labels.  Bugzilla Report 17646.

* The Unix wrapper script failed if you invoked it as a relative
  symlink and ANT_HOME has not been set.  Bugzilla Report 17721.

Other Changes:
--------------
* Added ability to specify manifest encoding for the <jar> and 
  <manifest> tasks

Changes from Ant 1.5.1 to Ant 1.5.2
===================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------
* ANT_OPTS environment variable is now applied at the start of the
  Java command line, allowing position specific parameters of some
  JVMs, such as -classic to be specified.

* ZipScanner#getIncludedFiles will now return the names of the ZipEntries
  that have been matched instead of the name of the archive.

* The <zip> task and friends have been heavily modified, almost every
  method signature of the Zip class has changed.  If you have subclassed
  Zip (or one of its subclasses), your class will most likely not
  compile against the current code base.  If it still compiles, it will
  probably not work as in Ant 1.5.1.

Fixed bugs:
-----------
* <translate> was not ignoring comment lines.

* <manifest> wouldn't update an existing manifest if only an attribute
  of an existing section changed.

* ant.bat now supports the ANT_ARGS and JAVACMD environment variables
  again (like Ant 1.5 did).

* The "plain" <junit> <formatter> could throw a NullPointerException
  if an error occured in setUp.

* <junit> will now produce output when a test times out as well.

* <replace> would count some internal character replacements when
  reporting the number of replaced tokens.

* <concat> would cause an exception if a <filelist> pointed to files
  that do not exist.

* <javadoc> will now pass -source to custom doclets as well.

* <cvstagdiff> would throw a NullPointException if there had been no
  differences.

* <cvschangelog> could miss today's changes.

* <concat> could append newline characters between concatenated files.

* <xmlvalidate> ignored the specified encoding of the files to
  validate.

* the errorsbeginat attribute of the <http> condition didn't work.

* Ant will try to force loading of certain packages like com.sun.*
  from the system classloader.  The packages are determined by the
  version of the JVM running Ant.

* Ant didn't find the runtime libraries on IBM's JDK 1.4 for Linux.

* random component of temporary files is now always a positive integer.

* Ant could incorrectly try to use the 1.4 regexp implementation even
  if it isn't available if you run the JVM with -Xverify:none.

* Ant would die with an exception if you used nested <reference>
  elements in Ant and the refid attribute didn't point to an existing
  project reference.

* The <get> task can now be compiled (and Ant thus bootstrapped) using
  Kaffee.

* build.sysclasspath will now be honored by more tasks.

* The signjar keystore attribute has been reverted to a String allowing
  it to once again accept URLs. This should not affect current File based usage
  unless you are extending the Signjar task.

* <jar update="true"> would remove the original manifest.

* fix up folder creation in PVCS task

* <tar>'s up-to-date check didn't work for nested <(tar)fileset>s.

* Corrected a problem in XMLLogger where it would not associated
  messages with a taskdef'd task

* <uptodate> now works when using attributes (i.e. not filesets) and pointing 
  to the same file

* Java task (and output system) now stores output which does not end
  with a line feed.

* splash screen wouldn't disappear when build was finished.

* <exec> now supports OS/2.

* <zip> and friends would only update/recreate existing archives if
  the files to add/update have been newer than the archive.

* <javadoc>'s <link> element could fail for offline="true" on some JDKs.

Other changes:
--------------

* MailLogger now sets the Date header correctly.

* Shipped XML parser is now Xerces 2.3.0

* signjar now accepts a maxmemory attribute to allow the memory allocated to the
  jarsigner tool to be specified. The jarsigner from the JDK's JAVA_HOME bin
  dir is now used rather than the first jarsigner on the path.

* **/.DS_Store has been added to the list of default pattern excludes.

* The Created-By header in the default manifest now contains the JVM
  vendor and version according to the jar specification. A new header,
  Ant-Version provides the Ant version used to create the jar.

* <zip> can now store Unix permissions in a way that can be
  reconstructed by Info-Zip's unzip command.

Changes from Ant 1.5.1Beta1 to 1.5.1
====================================

Fixed bugs:
-----------

* <tstamp>'s prefix attribute failed to apply to nested <format> elements.

* <junitreport> created an empty junit-noframes.html if no format had
  been specified.

* <basename> would remove more than it should if the file name
  contained more than one dot.

* <filterset>s nested into <filterset>s didn't work.

Other changes:
--------------

* Shipped XML parser is now Xerces 2.2.0

* Filesets now support a 'file' attribute, allowing a single-file
  fileset to be constructed without having to specify its parent
  directory separately.

* <junit> will now return the result of a call to getName instead of
  "unknown" for Test implementations that don't extend TestCase but have
  a public String getName() method.

Changes from Ant 1.5 to 1.5.1Beta1
==================================

Fixed bugs:
-----------
* Date/time in CvsChangeLog was in local timezone and 12 hour format leading
  to a problem when sorting by time. It is now UTC (GMT) and in 24-hour
  format as per cvs 'specifications'.

* CvsTagDiff now supports ampersand modules or modules that have a different
  root directory than their name.

* EjbJar threw NPEs for the Websphere element. The property 'websphere.home'
  was not documented.

* Mail example in the documentation was not correct.

* Checksum was broken in the following scenario:
  (using verifyproperty OR in a condition) AND using filesets
  with multiple files.

* The ExpandProperties filter threw NPEs when defined using
  the <filterreader> format.

* The sh wrapper script didn't work under Cygwin if ANT_HOME wasn't
  set with a Unix style filename.

* The sh wrapper script could fail if you started Ant from a directory
  with whitespace in its name.

* ant -diagnostics was not working properly when the task dependency
  was missing and was just printing the missing dependency.

* If a task got redefined via <taskdef>, it lost its child elements.

* <property>'s classpathref attribute was broken.

* <arg line="''" /> would result in no command line argument, will now
  be a single empty argument.  Use <arg value="''"/> if you need the
  quotes literally.

* <replaceregexp> could append a newline character at the end of the
  file.

Other changes:
--------------

* Appendix E of Java Development with Ant (Loughran/Hatcher) was
  contributed to the docs.

* <available> will only print deprecration warnings if it is actually
  used to change the value of a property.

Changes from Ant 1.5beta3 to Ant 1.5
====================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------

* The filesetmanifest attribute added to <jar> after the 1.4.1
  release has been removed for now.  This change may affect only
  the 1.5Beta/1.6Alpha users.  An attempt will be made to add this
  feature back into Ant 1.6.

Fixed bugs:
-----------

* <zip> and friends would always update existing archive if you set
  the update attribute to true.

* To support backward compatibility with older versions, <pathconvert>
  will once again set the property, even if the result is the empty
  string, unless the new 'setonempty' attribute is set to false|no|off
  (default is "true").

* The manifest task would crash XmlLogger

Other changes:
--------------

* added **/.svn and **/.svn/** to the default excludes

Changes from Ant 1.5beta2 to Ant 1.5beta3
=========================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------

* Project.getBuildListeners now returns a clone of the listener
  list. Changes to the returned list will not affect the listeners
  currently attached to the Project. It also means that it is safe to
  iterate over the returned list if listeners are added or removed
  during the traversal.

* <pvcs> default filenameformat has been different from Ant 1.4.1.
  Now it is different from 1.5beta1 and 1.5beta2.

* Some messages that are printed during startup will not be
  written to the logfile specified via -logfile as they might destroy
  the format of the file for special BuildLoggers (like XmlLogger).

* <pathconvert> won't set the property if the result is the empty string.

Fixed bugs:
-----------

* <available> could fail to find files or directories that happen to
  start with the name of the project's basedir but are not children of
  the basedir.

* Nested <property>'s inside <ant> can now be overriden by subsequent
  <ant> and <antcall> tasks.

* <xslt>'s outputtype attribute wouldn't do anything.

* <linecontains> filterreader could swallow lines.

* <sequential> used to configure the tasks (set their attributes)
  before the first task has been executed.  This means that properties
  that have been set by nested task seemed to be unset for the other
  tasks in the same <sequential> element.

* <javac>'s sourcepath setting has been ignored by some compiler
  implementations.

* <javadoc>'s packagelist attribute didn't work.

* the plain mailer would always use port 25 in <mail>.

* Ant's default logger could swallow empty lines.

* ejbjar's iPlanet nested element now can process multiple descriptors.

* IPlanetEjbc was looking in the wrong place for four iiop files.

* <javac> would pass the -source switch to JDK 1.3's javac, even
  though it doesn't support it.

Other changes:
--------------

* <checksum> now uses a buffer (of configurable size).

* The "Trying to override task definition" warning has been degraded
  to verbose level if the two task definitions only differ in the class
  loader instance that has loaded the definition.

* Add a jvmargs to the ejbjar's weblogic element to allow additional
  arguments to be provided to the VM runnign ejbc. Document the
  jvmdebuglevel attribute which can be used to avoid warnings about
  interface classess being found on the classpath. Document the new
  <sysproperty> element which allows JVM properties to be defined.
  Added an outputdir attribute to allow the destination to be a
  directory into which the exploded jar is written.

* ejbjar now supports Borland Enterprise Server 5 and Jonas 2.5

Changes from Ant 1.5beta1 to Ant 1.5beta2
=========================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------

* Properties will now be expanded in mail message bodies.  This means
that one $ sign will be stripped if your mail message contains the text
$$.

* org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Expand no longer extends MatchingTask.

* Available#setFile now again uses a File argument as it did in 1.4,
this may break environments that have been adapted to the String
argument version present in 1.5beta1.

Fixed bugs:
-----------
* When <move> attempts a rename, it deletes the destination file, if it
  exists, before renaming the source file.  However, <move> was not
  checking if the destination file was actually a directory before
  trying to delete it.

* Make CVS Tasks to work under Cygwin.

* Fix LineContains to handle huge files elegantly without causing
Stack Overflows.

* if you ask for the "classic" compiler on Java1.4, you get upgraded to
"modern" because there is no classic compiler any more.

* the <http> condition was viewing 404 'not found' exceptions as success. Now
it defaults to viewing any response >=400 as an error, and has an errorsBeginAt
attribute you can use if you want a higher or lower value.

* <get> throws a build exception on an http authorization error, unless you
have set ignoreerrors to true.

* <wsdltodotnet> was spelt in Wintel case: <WsdlToDotnet>. It is now lower
case, though the old spelling is retained for anyone who used it.

* Merging of Manifests in jar now works as documented.

* paths that have been separated by colons would be incorrectly parsed
on NetWare.

* runant.pl now supports NetWare.

* <tempfile> and <setproxy> tasks were in beta1, but not defined by
default; They now are. <tempfile> fills a property with the name of a
temporary file; <setproxy> lets you set the JVM's http, ftp and socks proxy
settings.

* <available classname="foo" ignoresystemclasses="true"> failed for
JDK 1.1 and 1.2, even if the class could be found on the
user-specified classpath.

* <property environment=... /> now works on z/OS.

* forked <javac> failed for the wrong reason on JDK 1.1 - Ant would
use a temporary file to hold the names of the files to compile under
some conditons, but 1.1 doesn't support this feature.  Ant will no
longer try this, but you may run into problems with the length of the
command line now.

* the refid attribute for <property>s nested into <ant> or <param>s
nested into <antcall> didn't work.

* <replaceregexp> didn't work for nested <fileset>s.

* <javadoc> dropped sourcepath entries if no "interesting" .java
source files  could be found below them.  This has been backwards
incompatible and caused problems with custom doclets like xdoclet.

* Using the doclet, docletpath or docletpathref attributes of
<javadoc> may have caused NullPointerExceptions.

* nested <filesets> of <javadoc> would include too much.

* <dependset> will no longer choke on <targetfileset>s that point to
non-existing directories.

* <patch> didn't work at all.

* <replace> and <replaceregexp> now fail if the file they are working
on is locked.

* <javadoc> would pick up the wrong executable in the combination JDK
1.2  and AIX.

Other changes:
--------------

* z/OS now gets detected by the os condition.

* <fileset> and <dirset> now have an optional followsymlink attribute
that can prevent Ant from following symbolic links on some platforms.

* BeanShell is now supported in the <script> task.

* <ejbjar> under Weblogic attempts to use the ejbc20 compiler for 2.0 beans
  based on the deployment descriptor's DTD reference. Under weblogic 7.00 Beta
  this ejbc class has been deprecated. To avoid the deprecation warning use
  ejbcclass="weblogic.ejbc".

* <ejbjar> will add a manifest to the generated jar based on the naming
  convention in use. This overrides the manifest specified in the
  <ejbjar> attribute


Changes from Ant 1.4.1 to 1.5beta1
==================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------

* Important: Single $ signs are no longer silently stripped!
  Before you panic that we have broken all your build files, we have kept
  the old "$$" -> "$" behaviour. So only build files which accidentally had
  a $ sign in a string that was being silently stripped may break.
  We added this fix to stop newbie confusion; if you want to write a
  build file which works on ant versions 1.4.1 or earlier, stay with
  the double $$ sign rule.

* Shipped XML parser is now Xerces 2.0.1 along with the XML Parser APIs.
  XML Parser APIs is a separate jar that contains the necessary
  JAXP/DOM/SAX classes.

* <telnet> was fixed to expand properties inside nested <read> and
  <write> elements; before this only happened when you assigned the text
  to the string attribute. If you had $ signs in the string, they may
  need escaping.

* the RegexpMatcher interface has been extended to support case
  insensitive matches and other options - custom implementations of
  this interface won't work any longer.  We recommend to use the new
  Regexp interface that also supports substitution instead of the
  RegexpMatcher interface in the future.

* <gzip> will throw an exception if your src attribute points to a directory.

* Unjar, Unzip and Unwar will throw an exception if the Src attribute
  represents a directory.  Support for nested filesets is provided
  instead.

* It is no longer possible to overwrite a property using tasks like
  <condition>, <exec>, <pathconvert>, or <tstamp>. In some exceptional
  cases it will generate a warning if you attempt to overwrite an
  existing property.

* Taskwriters please note: Whenever tasks had any overloaded set* methods,
  Ant's introspection mechanism would select the last overloaded method
  provided to it by the Java Runtime.  A modification has now been made such
  that when the Java Runtime provides a method with a String as its argument,
  a check is made to see if there is another overloaded method that takes in
  some other type of argument.  If there is one such method, then the method
  that takes in String as an argument is not selected by the Introspector.

* The pattern definition **/._* has been included into the Default
  Excludes list.

* <propertyfile>'s <entry> element was modified to remove "never" as a value
  as its behavior was undocumented and flakey.

* The -projecthelp flag now only prints out targets that include the
  'description' attribute, unless the -verbose or -debug flag is included
  on the Ant command line.

* Ant's testcases now require JUnit 3.7 or above, as they now use the new
  assertTrue method instead of assert.

* If the 'output' attribute of <ant> is set to a simple filename or a
  relative path, the file is created relative to ${basedir}, not ${user.dir}.

* The default value for build.compiler is now javac1.x with x
  depending on the JDK that is running Ant instead of classic/modern.

Fixed bugs:
-----------
* A bug existed that prevented generated log files from being deleted as
  part of the build process itself.  This has now been fixed.

* Fixed bug where <move> ignored <filterset>s.

* Ant works properly with the combination of Java1.4/WindowsXP.

* Fixed bug where <java> used to sometimes invoke class constructors twice.

* Fixed bug with 4NT shell support.

* Fixed bug where ant would not perform ftp without remotedir being
  specified even though this was not mandatory.

* Fixed bug where ant would not copy system properties into new Project
  in ant/antcall tasks when inheritall="false" is set.

* <propertyfile> would not close the original property file.

* <ant> will no longer override a subbuild's basedir with inheritall="true".

* Fixed problem with the built-in <junit> formatters which assumed
  that only one test could be running at the same time - this is not
  necessarily true, see junit.extensions.ActiveTestSuite.

* <jar>'s whenEmpty attribute is useless as JARs are never empty, they
  contain at least a manifest file, therefore it will now print a
  warning and do nothing.

* <typedef> hasn't been all that useful as it couldn't be used outside
  of targets (it can now) and nested "unknown" elements have always
  been considered to be tasks (changed as well).

* <fixcrlf> would fail for files that contained lines longer than 8kB.

* Some junit formatters incorrectly assumed that all testcases would
  inherit from junit.framework.TestCase.

* <fixcrlf> dropped the first characters from Mac files.

Other changes:
--------------
* Selector Elements now provide a way to create filesets based on
  sophisticated selection criteria.

* Gzip and Bzip2 files can now be constructed in the fly when using
  the tar task without having to create the intermediate tar file on
  disk.  The Untar task can also untar GZip and BZip2 files on the fly
  without creating the intermediate tar file.

* New optional type, <classfileset> added.

* <ejbjar> now allows control over which additional classes and interfaces
  are added to the generated EJB jars. A new attribute "dependency" can be
  defined which controls what classes are added. The addition of classes now uses
  the Jakarta-BCEL library rather than reflection, meaning bean classes are
  no longer loaded into Ant's JVM. The default dependency analyzer is known as
  the ancestor analyzer. It provides the same behaviour as the 1.4.1 version of
  <ejbjar>. If the BCEL library is not present, a warning will be issued stating
  the ancestor analyzer is not available. In this case <ejbjar> will continue
  to function but will not add super classes to the jar.

* <available> has a new attribute named ignoreSystemClasses.

* New task <cvschangelog/> generates an XML report of changes that occur
  on CVS repository.

* New filter readers: ClassConstants, ExpandProperties, HeadFilter,
  LineContains, LineContainsRegExp, PrefixLines, ReplaceTokens,
  StripJavaComments, StripLineBreaks, StripLineComments, TabsToSpaces,
  TailFilter.

* <copy>, <loadfile>, <loadproperties>, <move> support FilterChains
  of FilterReaders.

* New task <loadproperties> to load contents of file as Ant properties,
  with nested <filterchain> elements.

* New task <loadfile> to load a whole file into a property.

* New task <echoproperties> to list your current properties to the screen
  or a file.

* New tasks <bzip2> and <bunzip2> to pack and unpack files using the
  BZip2 alogrithm.

* New tasks <replaceregexp>, <checksum>, <translate>, <waitfor>,
  <manifest>, <vsscp>, <vssadd>, <vsscreate>, <splash>, <basename>, <dirname>,
  <concat>, <sourceoffsite>, <jarlib-available>, <jarlib-display>,
  <jarlib-manifest>, <jarlib-resolve>.

* A new combined <mail> task, which replaces the old <mail> and
  <mimemail> tasks, has been added.  The <mimemail> task, and
  old SendEmail and MimeMail classes have been deprecated.

* Mail task allows specification of port number.

* Users can control what <zip> and <jar> must do when duplicate files
  are found.  A new element <zipgroupfileset> allows for multiple zip
  files to be merged into the archive.  In addition, <jar> also has
  another new attribute: filesetmanifest.  The existing manifest
  attribute of <jar> now also accepts the name of a jar added through
  a fileset.

* gzip now checks that the zipfile is older than the source file
  before rebuilding the zipfile.

* TarFileset takes in three new attributes - fullpath, prefix
  and preserveLeadingSlashes.

* <move> attempts to rename the directory, if everything inside it is
  included, before performing file-by-file moves.  This attempt will
  be done only if filtering is off and if mappers are not used.  This
  is a performance improvement and there is no change otherwise in
  the funtionality of this task.

* Exec task has extra attribute "resultproperty" to get the return code
  into a property.

* Exec task prints a message when a timed-out process is killed.

* Added optional attributes - name, arch and version to the <os> task.

* Unjar, Untar, Unwar and Unzip now support patternsets to
  select files from an archive for extraction.  Filesets may be
  used to select archived files for unarchival.

* Javac task allows debug levels to be specified.  Debug levels
  will have an effect only when the modern compiler or the
  classic compiler (version 1.2 and higher) is used and debugging
  is enabled.

* Added support for specifying CVS_RSH in the <cvs/> task

* The attributes zipfile, jarfile, warfile and earfile (from the Zip,
  Jar, War and Ear tasks) have been deprecated and superseded by a
  new attribute "destfile".

* Added new conditions <isset>, <checksum>, <http>, <socket>, <contains>,
  <filesmatch>.

* <taskdef> and <typedef> will now emit a warning if a task/type of
  the given name already exists.

* A new revision of VAJ tasks: The most important new feature
  is the ability to execute VAJ tasks from the command line by
  exploiting the Remote Tool Access feature of VAJ.

* Improved support for Novell NetWare.

* Added an optional encoding attribute to <fixcrlf>.

* <apply> has a new attribute relative that allows users to pass the
  filenames as relative instead of absolute paths on the command line.

* References can now be copied into the child build by <ant> and
  <antcall> using nested <reference> elements or the new inheritRefs
  attribute.

* <fail> now supports builds to fail based on conditions via if and
  unless attributes.

* Ant now comes with two new BuildLogger implementations - one that
  can send emails containing a log of the build process (MailLogger),
  and one that colorizes the output based on message levels, using
  ANSI color code escape sequences (AnsiColorLogger).

* A "package" mapper type has been added to allow package directory
  names replaced with the dotted form.

* You can now specify environment variables in the <java> and <junit> tasks
  if the fork attribute has been set to true.

* -propertyfile command-line option has been added to load an entire
  property file just as -D properties are declared (as user properties).
  -D properties take precedence over -propertyfile specified ones.

* You can now set an ANT_ARGS environment variable to hold arguments you
  always want passed to the 'ant' command -- for example, if you always
  want to use a different logger or the -find flag.

* <tstamp> now supports a new "prefix" attribute to prefix properties set.

* You can now specify the -sourcepath for <javac> explicitly.

* <javac> now supports a new "listfiles" attribute to list the source
  files it's handing off to the compiler.

* The compiler implementation for <javac> can now be chosen on a task by
  task basis.  The new "compiler" attribute of <javac> can be used to override
  the value of the build.compiler property, if set.

* <javac> has a new nested element, <compilerarg>, which allows you
  to specify additional args for the specific compiler you're using.

* <javac>'s "source" attribute is now enabled for jikes as well.

* <propertyfile>'s <entry> now has a 'unit' attribute to specify the
  increment/decrement unit on date operations.

* <property> now supports a 'prefix' attribute when loading from a file
  or resource.

* In Ant 1.4, a feature has been added to the <junit> task that would
  add ant.jar, optional.jar and junit.jar implicitly to the classpath -
  this feature can now be disabled by setting the new includeantruntime
  attribute to false.

* <style> behaves differently from any other directory-based task, as it
  processes all files that it finds in included directories in
  addition to the files matched by your patterns.  There is now a new
  attribute, 'scanincludeddirectories', to suppress this behavior.

* <javadoc> now supports a <tag> nested element to provide the -tag option
  to the standard Java 1.4 doclet. The element is ignored when not running
  on Java 1.4.

* <ftp> can now chmod files on a remote server that supports
  "site chmod", as well as set the umask before transferring files, if
  the server supports "site umask".

* New <serverdeploy> "optional" task.

* <patternset> now supports nested patternsets.

* Perforce tasks now support a "failonerror" attribute (defaults to "true").

* Open Source application server JOnAS support:
    EJB hot deploy and deploy with <serverdeploy> and <ejbjar>

* Added new DirSet (<dirset>) datatype.

* <path> now supports nested <dirset> and <filelist> elements.

* <pathconvert> now supports nested <dirset> and <filelist> elements.

* <pathconvert>'s "dirsep" and "pathsep" attributes now accept
  multi-character values.

* <copy> task now has a 'failonerror' attribute to allow keep-going
  behaviour when the file to be copied is not found (defaults to "true").

* <uptodate> now has a 'srcfile' attribute to allow specifying a
  full-path filename.

* <exec>, <sql> and <java> now support append attributes to allow
  appending the output to an existing file.

* <java> now supports a timeout attribute analog to <exec> - it is
  highly recommended to only use it together with fork="true".

* <javadoc> now supports a source attribute to enable javadoc to
  handle assertions present in JDK 1.4 source code.

* <replace> supports a new replacefilterfile attribute that
  automatically turns all properties of a given file into
  replacefilters.

* An alias of <xslt> has been added to refer to the <style> task.

* The compiler implementation for <rmic> can now be chosen on a task by
  task basis.  The new "compiler" attribute of <rmic> can be used to override
  the value of the build.rmic property, if set.

* <rmic> has a new nested element, <compilerarg>, which allows you
  to specify additional args for the specific compiler you're using.

* org.apache.tools.ant.XmlLogger now is a BuildLogger, rather than just
  a BuildListener. It can operate in either mode successfully.

* <junit> has a new attribute "showoutput".  If set to true, output
  generated by tests will be sent to Ant's logging system as well as
  to the formatters (instead of sending it to the formatters
  exclusively).

* Ant has now a pluggable way to prompt users for input, which is used
  by the new <input> task.  IDE integrators can provide an
  implementation of the InputHandler interface to decouple Ant's input
  from the console.  An implementation that gets its input from a file
  for unattended builds is part of Ant's distribution.

  For more details see docs/manual/inputhandler.html.

* <patch> has a new attribute that selects the directory in which to
  run the command.

* <javadoc> now supports two new nested elements, <fileset> and <packageset>.

Changes from Ant 1.4 to Ant 1.4.1
===========================================

Fixed bugs:
-----------

* <ant>'s antfile attribute will now also be considered an absolute path on
  Windows systems, if it starts with a \ and no drive specifier.

* The fullpath attribute of <zipfileset> has been ignored if you used
  the src attribute at the same time.

* The manifest file is now always placed as the second entry (after /META-INF)
  in generated jars. This allows the manifest to be read by JarInputStreams

* Fixed bug in depend task which would fail with a NullPointerException if no
  dependency cache was specified.

* sql task now handles REM statements correctly so that lines starying with rem
  but which are not comments are actually processed.

* XMLLogger now uses the task's name rather than the classname

* <mapper>s will now work as expected if the to pattern expands to an
  absolute pathname.

* <javac> didn't ignore memory settings in non-fork mode

* <cab> didn't split the options attribute into several command line
  arguments correctly.

Other changes:
--------------

* New source attribute for <javac> to enable assertion in JDK 1.4

* XmlLogger and <antstructure> now add an encoding declaration to the
  XML files they generate.

* <fileset> has a new attribute "casesensitive" to make it match
  filenames in a case insensitive way (if you set it to false) - by
  default filesets remain case sensitive.

Changes from Ant 1.3 to Ant 1.4
===========================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------
* JUnitReport now uses the xalan redirect extension for multi-output.
  With Xalan 1.2.2 it forces the use of bsf.jar in the classpath.
  (Available in the xalan distribution). It is recommended to switch
  to Xalan 2.x that do not need it.

* Zip.setWhenempty() has changed its signature.

* <rmic> is now implemented using a factory. This makes extending
  rmic to use a new compiler a lot easier but may break custom
  versions of this task that rely on the old implementation.

* several Zip methods have changed their signature as we now use a Zip
  package of our own that handles Unix permissions for directories.
  Furthermore <zip> will now use the platform's default character
  encoding for filenames - this is consistent with the command line
  ZIP tools, but causes problems if you try to open them from within
  Java and your filenames contain non US-ASCII characters. Use the new
  encoding attribute of the task and set it to UTF8 to get the old
  behavior.

* The <pvcs> task has been moved to a package of its own.

* JUnitResultFormater has two additional methods that must be
  implemented by custom formatters.

* Ant will no longer use the canonical version of a path internally -
  this may yield different results on filesystems that support
  symbolic links.

* The output generated by the xml formatter for <junit> has changed
  again, it doesn't format the numeric value in the time attribute anymore.

* Pattern matching rules have changes slightly, the pattern foo*
  doesn't match files contained in a directory named foo - use foo/*
  instead.

* <fixcrlf> will not remove trailing whitespace at the end of lines anymore.

* The Classloader usage has been changed for the taskdef, property, available
  and sql tasks so that it delegates to the parent classloader. This may cause
  ClassNotFoundExceptions to be thrown if a system class attempts to load a
  class in the taskdef's classpath (typically factory objects).

* Ant now allows multithreading of tasks and the containment of tasks within
  other tasks. This can break customer listeners which do not expect messages
  from a task before the previous task has finished.

* Ant now installs its own ouput stream into System.out to route output to the
  task currently executing on the current thread. This also means that all
  output is now routed as Ant message events. Customer listeners and loggers
  should not call System.out at any time. This has always been true but such
  usage now will cause problems due to possible recursion.

* Invalid manifest files will now cause build failures in the <jar> task.

* Ant Introspection now looks for methods with method names starting with
  addConfigured. When called these methods are passed an argument after it has
  been configured from the build file. Custom tasks supporting nested elements
  starting with the name configured will no longer function.

* The environment variable JAVACMD that can be used to specify the
  java executable to Ant's wrapper scripts must not contain additional
  command line parameters any longer - please use the environment
  variable ANT_OPTS for such parameters now.

* Ant's wrapper scripts now quote the CLASSPATH environment variable, thus
  supporting classpaths which refer to directories containing spaces. This means
  that the CLASSPATH environment variable cannot have quotes. Any quotes should
  be removed. This will not affect the operation of the CLASSPATH environment
  variable in other contexts.

* A delete task like
  <delete includeEmptyFilesets="true">
    <fileset dir="somedir" />
  </delete>
  will now remove "somedir" as well, unless there are still files left
  in it (matched by the default excludes).

* The copy task will now fail if the file to be copied is not found.

* Ant properties defined in properties files now behave the same way as
  properties defined in the build file. In particular the $ character needs
  to be escaped in property values by doubling it to $$. So, to define a
  property with the value $hello, you need to define it in a properties file
  as
    test.prop=$$hello
  This was not the case in Ant 1.3

Other changes:
--------------

* New tasks: ear, p4counter, record, cvspass, vsscheckin, vsscheckout,
  typedef, sleep, mimemail, set of tasks for Continuus/Synergy, dependset,
  condition, maudit, mmetrics, jpcoverage, jpcovreport, jpcovmerge

* Ant now uses JAXP 1.1

* rmic now supports Kaffe's and Weblogic's version of rmic.

* new magic property build.rmic to chose the rmic implementation

* <tar> will now add empty directories as well

* you can now specify a description for <p4change>

* <touch> can now work on <fileset>s

* <uptodate> now supports a value attribute

* <fail> supports nested text

* <fixcrlf> won't override files that are already in the correct
   format.

* <sql> now supports REM comments as well as // and --

* <jar> now has a nested <metainf> element following the same idea as
  <war>'s <webinf>.

* <pvcs> can now handle multiple projects.

* <available> now has a "type" attribute you can use in conjunction
  with the "file" attribute to specify whether the "file" you're
  looking for is a file or a directory.

* New <junit> formatter named "brief"

* <ejbjar> changes
  * Add support for Borland Application Server to the <ejbjar> task using
    a <borland> nested element.
  * Add support for iPlanet Application Server to the <ejbjar> task. Also
    includes some iPlanet utility tasks
  * Add support for JBoss Application Server to the <ejbjar> task.
  * Add a naming attribute to control the naming scheme that
    ejbjar uses to name the generated EJB jars.
  * Weblogic element now sets the compiler class for EJB 2.0 beans
  * <dtd> elements can be specified at the <ejbjar> level for building generic
    beans
  * <dtd> elements can now be URLs
  * Allow the manifest to be specified for the generated jars
  * The weblogic element now supprts an attribte noEJBC to skip the processing
    of the jar by ejbc. The ejbc step will then occur at deployment
  * weblogic will tell ejbc to use Jikes compiler if build.compiler is set to
    jikes. It can be restored to the default, javac, operation if desired.

* Allow the <sql> Delimiter to be set in the so that Oracle stored procs may be
  entered

* <execon> and <apply> can now optionally skip empty filesets.

* <javadoc> has a new useexternalfile attribute that makes it use a
  temporary file for sourcefile and package names - helps to defeat
  command line length limitations.

* Data types like <path> can now be defined inside of <target>s

* you can now specify a classpath for <style> - the XSLZ processor
  will be loaded from this path

* added a force attribute to <style> to support dependencies that the
  task cannot determine itself (dependency on parameters, not file
  modification times for example)

* added vmlauncher attribute to exec tasks. This defaults to true. If
  it is set to false, the VM's ability to launch commands in bypassed
  and the OS shell, either directly or through the auxillary antRun
  scripts is used.

* regexp mapper now supports the java.util.regex package of JDK 1.4.

* New filesonly attribute for <zip> and friends to suppress directory
  entries.

* New update attribute for <zip> and friends - update an existing
  archive instead of creating a new one.

* <apply> and <execon> have been merged into a single task.

* added vssver.scc to the default excludes

* <available> has a new filepath attribute/nested element that allows
  you top search for a file in a given path.

* <junit> can now optionally set a property on test failure.

* <taskdef> can now define several tasks at once, reading the
  name/classname pairs from a property file or resource.

* <unzip/unjar/unwar> and <untar> now have an overwrite attribute that
  defaults to true.  If set to false, files that are newer than the
  files in the archive will not be replaced.

* <patternset> and <fileset> now support nested <in/excludesfile>
  elements - using these you can have more than one in/excludes file
  per <patternset>.

* Three new supported compilers for javac: kjc for kopi, gcj for the
  gcc frontend and sj for Symantec's compiler.
  In addition extJavac or the new fork attribute can be
  used to run the JDK's javac in a JVM separate from Ant.

* <fixrlf> can now with CR only line-ends and can use an arbitraty
  between 2 and 80.

* The .NET tasks have been adapted to the beta2 release of the framework.

* <move> will now try to rename() files before copying them byte by
  byte - only if filtering is of, of course.

* <ant> and <antcall> tasks now support a new attribute inheritAll. When set to
  false, only user properties are passed through to the target Ant instance.
  This includes properties set on the command line and properties explicitly
  passed

* <javadoc> now skips off line links if the package list cannot be found.

* <wlrun> now allows the security policy file to exist outside the weblogic
  directory.

* <java> task will set the Thread contextClassLoader under JDKs 1.2+ to the
  classloader for the class being executed.

* Introduce the concept of a TaskContainer - a task or element which can contain
  Ant Tasks.

* Add new tasks implementing the TaskContainer interface <parallel> and
  <sequential> which allow parallel execution of tasks to be specified.

* <depend> task will now take into account dependencies on jar files and class
  files from a given classpath.

* <jar> manifest entries may now be specified in the build file either
  completely or to be merged with a manifest file.

* <tstamp> task custom formats now support locales.

* Added a listner which will forward events to Log4J. The log4j configuration
  file should be in the directory from which Ant is run or passed as a system
  property using a JVM argument.

* Introduced the concept of <filtersets> to allow for more control in which
  filters get applied in a <copy> or <move> operation.

* Added nowarn attribute to javac and deprecated the Jikes-magic property
  build.compiler.warnings.

* The <depend> task cache format has changed and all dependency information is
  now stored in a single file.

Fixed bugs:
-----------

* Testcases have been made independent of current working directory.

* Input ZIP-Files will be closed when using a <zipfileset>.

* p4 tasks now don't fail if user, port or client have been omitted
  (and this is acceptable for the context of the command).

* <javah>'s outputfile attribute will be resolved as relative to the
  projects basedir.

* <antstructure> should create a valid DTD for propertyfile.operation.entry
  and omit tasks it fails to load.

* won't try to pass a -bootclasspath flag to javac 1.1 anymore

* <style>'s style attribute no handles absolute paths correctly.

* <delete includeemptydirs="true"> now deletes more than just the leaf
  directories.

* You can now specify a <fileset> for a directory that doesn't exist at
  declaration time but will created before the fileset gets used for the
  first time.

* If the quiet attribute has been set, <delete> will handle <fileset>s
  with non-existing directories gracefully.

* Output written by testcases will now be captured by the <junit> task
  and passed to the formatters.

* Quote the -group parameter to Javadoc as per the specification

* Initialise classes when loaded through the AntClassLoader - that is, run
  static initializers

* Implement getResource() and getResources() in AntClassLoader

* Create the <ejbjar> weblogic command line as a set of arguments rather than
  as a single line. Avoids problems with paths which contain spaces.

* <ejbjar> now fails when the weblogic ejbc compiler reports an error.

* Make the AntClassLoader load resources in the same order as it currently
  loads classes.

* Handle classpaths with spaces

* Make sure XSLT processors close their output files in <style>.

* perform proper uptodate check in <rmic> when compiling for IIOP.

* <jjtree>'s uptodate test works even if outputdirectory is not the
  parent dir of target

* <copy> will remove target file (if it exists) before writing to it -
  this avoids problems with links on filesystems that support them.

* <ftp> now properly recurses remote directories.

* <ftp> closes remote connection when it's done.

* <junit> tries to include all necessary classes for the task itself
  to the classpath when running in fork mode - doesn't work for JDK 1.1

* <apply> and <execon> do now execute the command only once, if you
  specify the parallel attribute - instead of once per fileset.

* directory based tasks and fileset could miss some included files in
  directories that have been excluded

* <fixcrlf> failed for large files.

* <move> removed files you tried to move to themselves.

* <sql> task will not trty to print the result set unless the query succeeded.

* Ant classloader will now ignore paths which are invalid relative to the
  project base

* <ejbjar> weblogic elements check for jar file changes has been fixed.
  Previously some changes would not be included.

* properties loaded from properties files are now resolved internally. This
  removes the spurious warnings about usage of properties which have not been
  set.

* <jar> task and friends now process the JAR manifest to ensure it is valid.

* The task finished event now includes any exception thrown by the task.

* <java> task now supports a jvmVersion attribute so that if another JVM is
  being used, Ant can determine which options to use for features such as the
  VM memory limits


Changes from Ant 1.2 to Ant 1.3
===========================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------

* Ant doesn't search for the buildfile anymore, unless you use the new
  -find argument.

* <perforce> has been replaced by a number of new tasks.

* <javac> is now implemented using a factory. This makes extending
  javac to use a new compiler a lot easier but may break custom
  versions of this task that rely on the old implementation.

* The output generated by the xml formatter for <junit> has changed a
  little, it doesn't append " sec" in the time attribute anymore.

Other changes:
--------------

* A GUI Frontend: Antidote. This is currently in development. At this
  time, this is not part of the Ant release, although the source is
  included if you are interested.

* New tasks: stylebook, propertyfile, depend, antlr, telnet, csc,
  ilasm, apply, javah, several clearcase tasks, junitreport, sound

* Added output attribute to <java>.

* Added nested zipfileset element to <zip>

* Changed <sql> so that printing is at the task level rather than
  the statement level.

* javadoc task will pass -d flag to any doclet if the destDir attribute is
  given. If the doclet does not accept the -d flag then omit the destdir
  attribute.

* <cab> can work on non-Windows platforms with the help of libcabinet.
  See http://trill.cis.fordham.edu/~barbacha/cabinet_library/.

* <ftp> now supports passive mode.

* New <mapper> data type that can be used to get influence on the
  target files for some tasks like <copy> or enable new types of tasks
  like <apply>.

* <execon> provides more control over the command line now, the names
  of the source files are no longer required to be at the end of the
  command.

* Style tasks will now support TraX compliant XSL processors if one is present
  in your classpath.

* Added a failonerror to the javac task. If set to false, the build will
  continue even if there are compilation errors.

* Added nested format elements to the tstamp task allowing additional time
  formats to be defined for arbitrary properties.

* Added classpath attribute and nested classpath element to <property>
  to make the resource attribute more powerful.

* ${} property expansion will now be performed on the patterns read
  from files specified as includesfile or excludesfile attributes.

* The <tar> and <untar> tasks now support GNU format for handling paths
  which are greater than 100 characters in length. In addition the <tar>
  task now supports nested filesets through which the file permissions
  may be controlled.

* wlrun, wlstop and ejbjar now support Weblogic 6.0

* The MPasre task has been updated to work with MParse 2.0

* The documentation has been significantly updated.


Fixed bugs:
-----------

* <signjar> doesn't use deprectated methods anymore.

* javadoc's failonerror attribute works again

* javadoc's additionalparam attribute will now be split into separate
  parameters (on spaces) to allow for more than one parameter.

* Changed <sql> task so that printing result sets works on Oracle

* Changes to ddcreator and ejbc helper to respect the descriptor hierarchy
  keppgenerated in ejbc can now be turned off

* ejbjar now correctly ignores <ejb-ref> elements in the deployment descriptor.
  CMP files are included by parsing the weblogic deployment descriptor rather
  than relying on the naming convention used in ant 1.2

* ejbjar includes super classes and super interfaces into the generated ejb
  jar files. The <support> nested element allows support classes to be
  included in the EJB jar. The toplink element should now correctly locate
  the toplink descriptor.

* <vssget> now correctly deals with spaces in arguments

* <jar> fails early if a given manifest file doesn't exist

* <rmic> doesn't search for the _Skel file anymore when stubversion is
  set to 1.2.

* <rmic> uses the the same classpath to verify a class can be rmic'd
  as it passes to the compiler.

* org.apache.tools.mail.MailMessage (and therefore <mail>) can now
  handle SMTP servers sending multi line responses.

* nested <classpath> elements of <taskdef> now work for <taskdef>s not
  nested into <target> as well.

* <property> and <available> will search for the resource "foo" instead
  of "/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/foo" when given a relative resource
  name foo.

* Handle build files in directories whose name contained a "#" character

* <junit> can now log to files whose name contains a comma as well.

* The AntClassLoader now refers to the loader which loaded it, any
  requests it does not handle itself. Previously these went to the
  primordial loader.

Changes from Ant 1.1 to Ant 1.2
===============================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------

* Semantics of <property> has changed again in the hope to be more
intuitive. ${} expansion now happens at runtime and <property> tags
living inside of targets only take effect if they are visited at
runtime.

As a side effect of this change, task's attributes get set at runtime
not at parser time as well, which might change the results of
<script>s or other custom tasks that reference other tasks by their id
attribute.

* copying of support files in <javac> has been removed - as well as
the filtering attribute.

* the <expand> and <keysubst> tasks have been removed.

* the ignore and items attributes of directory based tasks have been removed.

* the command line switches _not_ starting with - have been removed.

* Path and EnumeratedAttribute have been moved from
org.apache.tools.ant to org.apache.tools.ant.types.

* the class attributes of <available>, <java>, <rmic> and <taskdef>
have been removed.

* the src attribute of <chmod> has been removed.

* <patch> and <javadoc> have lost some of their attributes.

* <java> and <cvs> have lost some undocumented attributes.

* the Unix antRun script would search for command.sh in the directory
it changed to and invoke this instead of command if present. This
behavior has been dropped.

* <ejbjar> task syntax has been changed significantly

* <exec> is no longer implemented by org.apache.tool.ant.taskdefs.Exec.
Custom tasks that rely on Project.createTask("exec") to return an
instance of this class are going to fail.

* nested <include> and <exclude> elements expect the value of their
name attribute to be a single pattern, they don't accept multiple
patterns anymore. Split them into multiple elements of the same type.

* <delete dir="somedir" /> will now delete the directory itself as
well as all included files. If you just want to clean out the
directory and keep the empty one, use a nested fileset.

Other changes:
--------------

* New tasks: antstructure, cab, execon, fail, ftp, genkey, jlink,
junit, sql, javacc, jjtree, starteam, war, unwar, uptodate,
native2ascii, copy, move, mparse.

* copydir, copyfile, deltree and rename are now deprecated. They
should be replaced with the new copy, delete and move tasks.

* <java> uses a ClassLoader of its own in no-fork mode if a classpath is
specified.

* <style> will create the necessary target directories and reprocess
all files if the stylesheet changes.

* New data types fileset and patternset - expected to get a broader use.
They, as well as PATH like structures, can now be defined on a global
level and later be referenced by their id attribute.

* You can specify environment variables to <exec>.

* <get> can check whether a remote file is actually newer than a local
copy before it starts a download (HTTP only).

* Added a -logger option to allow the class which performs logging to be
specified on the command line.

* Added a -emacs option to tell the logger to leave out taskname adornments
on log output.

* <chmod> works on all files in parallel and supports multiple filesets.

* <replace> can now use tokens and/or values that cross line boundaries.

* build.compiler supports now jvc as well.

* project specific help can now be obtained with the -projecthelp option.

* Added a -debug option to make -verbose less verbose (and more useful)

* Ant will now search for a file named build.xml in the parent directory
and above (towards the root of the filesystem) if you didn't specify
-buildfile and there is no build.xml in the current directory.

* <echo> can now write to a file and accepts nested text.

Fixed bugs:
-----------

* <chmod> didn't work when used as a directory based task.

* Path, Available, Property didn't resolve relative filenames with
respect to the Project's basedir.

* Project didn't interpret the basedir attribute correctly in all
cases.

* Nested <src> in <javac> caused NullPointerException.

* Corrupt Zip- and Jar-files ar now deleted if the task fails.

* many more fixes we've forgotten to document here ...

* The packagelistloc attribute of <javadoc>'s <link> child will be
  resolved as a file (i.e. it is either absolute or relative to
  basedir).
