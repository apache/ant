version: "1.10.8alpha"
summary: Apache Ant
description: |
  Apache Ant™ is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is
  to drive processes described in build files as targets and extension
  points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the
  build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks
  allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant
  can also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for
  instance C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to
  pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets
  and tasks.

  Ant is written in Java and thus requires Java 8 or a later runtime
  environment to be installed. If you want to build a Java project you
  will need a Java Development Kit rather than just a Java Runtime
  Environment.
