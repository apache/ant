<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Ant is a Java based build tool. In theory it is kind of like make without
make's wrinkles.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Why another build tool when there is already make, gnumake, nmake, jam, and
others? Because all of those tools have limitations that its original author
couldn't live with when developing software across multiple platforms. Make like
tools are inherently shell based. They evaluate a set of dependencies and then
execute commands not unlike what you would issue on a shell. This means that you
can easily extend these tools by using or writing any program for the OS that
you are working on. However, this also means that you limit yourself to the OS,
or at least the OS type such as Unix, that you are working on.</p>
<p>Makefiles are inherently evil as well. Anybody who has worked on them for any
time has run into the dreaded tab problem. &quot;Is my command not executing
because I have a space in front of my tab!!!&quot; said the original author of
Ant way too many times. Tools like Jam took care of this to a great degree, but
still use yet another format to use and remember.</p>
<p>Ant is different. Instead a model where it is extended with shell based
commands, it is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell commands,
the configuration files are XML based calling out a target tree where various
tasks get executed. Each task is run by an object which implements a particular
Task interface.</p>
<p>Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by being
able to construct a shell command such as `find . -name foo -exec rm {}` but it
gives you the ability to be cross platform. To work anywhere and everywhere. And
hey, if you really need to execute a shell command, Ant has an exec rule that
allows different commands to be executed based on the OS that it is executing
on.</p>

<h3>Binary edition</h3>
<p>The latest stable version of Ant can be downloaded from <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v3.0/ant.zip">http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v3.0/ant.zip</a>.
If you like living on the edge, you can download the latest version from <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/nightly/ant.zip">http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/nightly/ant.zip</a>.</p>
<h3>Source edition</h3>
<p>If you prefer the source edition, you can download Ant from <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v3.0/src/jakarta-tools.src.zip">http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v3.0/src/jakarta-tools.src.zip</a>
(latest stable) or from <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/from-cvs/jakarta-tools/">http://jakarta.apache.org/from-cvs/jakarta-ant/</a>
(current). See the section <a href="#buildingant">Building Ant</a> on how to
build Ant from the source code.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="sysrequirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>
  To build and use ant you must have a JAXP compilant XML parser installed and available on your classpath.
  <p>
  If you do not have a JAXP compliant XML parse installed, you may use the reference implementation 
  available from Sun. It is available from <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml">http://java.sun.com/xml</a>.
  Once installed make sure the "jaxp.jar" and "parser.jar" files are in your classpath.
  <p>
  You will also need the JDK installed on your system, version 1.1 or later. 

<hr>  
<h2><a name="buildingant">Building Ant</a></h2>
<p>Go to the directory <code>jakarta-ant</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure the JDK is in you path.</p>
<p>Run <code>bootstrap.bat</code> (Windows) or <code>bootstrap.sh</code> (UNIX)
to build a bootstrap version of Ant.</p>
<p>When finished, use</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>build.bat -Dant.dist.dir=&lt;directory to install Ant&gt; dist</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>for Windows, and</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>build.sh -Dant.dist.dir=&lt;directory to install Ant&gt; dist</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>for UNIX, to create a binary distribution of Ant. This distribution can be
found in the directory you specified.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="installing">Installing Ant</a></h2>
<p>The binary distribution of Ant consists of three directories: <code>bin</code>,
<code>docs</code> and <code>lib</code>. Only the <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code>
directory are crucial for running Ant. To run Ant, the following must be done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add the <code>bin</code> directory to your path.</li>
  <li>Set the ANT_HOME environment variable. This should be set to the directory
    which contains the <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code> directory.</li>
  <li>Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. This should be set to the
    directory where the JDK is installed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Assume Ant is installed in <code>c:\ant\</code>. The following sets up the
environment:</p>
<pre>set ANT_HOME=c:\ant
set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.2.2
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin</pre>
<h3>Unix (bash)</h3>
<p>Assume Ant is installed in <code>/usr/local/ant</code>. The following sets up
the environment:</p>
<pre>export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/ant
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk-1.2.2
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin</pre>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>There are lots of variants that can be used to run Ant. What you need is at
least the following:</p>
<p>The classpath for Ant must contain <code>ant.jar</code> and any jars/classes 
needed for your chosen JAXP compliant XML parser.</p>
<p>When you need JDK functionality (like a <a href="#javac">javac</a> task, or a
<a href="#rmic">rmic</a> task), then for JDK 1.1, the <code>classes.zip</code>
file of the JDK must be added to the classpath; for JDK 1.2, <code>tools.jar</code>
must be added. The scripts supplied with ant, in the bin directory, will add 
<code>tools.jar</code> automatically if the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set.</p>
<p>When you are executing platform specific applications (like the <a
href="#exec">exec</a> task, or the <a href="#cvs">cvs</a> task), the property <code>ant.home</code>
must be set to the directory containing a bin directory, which contains the <code>antRun</code> shell script necessary to run execs on Unix.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="running">Running Ant</a></h2>
<p>Running Ant is simple, when you installed it as described in the previous
section. Just type <code>ant</code>.</p>
<p>When nothing is specified, Ant looks for a <code>build.xml</code> file in the
current directory. When found, it uses that file as a buildfile. To make Ant use
another buildfile, use the commandline option <i>-buildfile &lt;file&gt;</i>,
where <i>&lt;file&gt;</i> is the buildfile you want to use.</p>
<p>You can also set properties which override properties specified in the
buildfile (see the <a href="#property">property task</a>). 
This can be done with the <i>-D&lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</i>
option, where <i>&lt;property&gt;</i> is the name of the property and <i>&lt;value&gt;</i>
the value.</p>
<p>To more options are <i>-quiet</i> which instructs Ant to print less
information on the console when running. The option <i>-verbose</i> on the other
hand makes Ant print more information on the console.</p>
<p>It is also possible to specify the target that should be executed. Default
the target that is mentioned in the <i>default</i> attribute of the project is
used. This can be overridden by adding the target name to the end of the
commandline.</p>
<p>Commandline option summary:</p>
<pre>ant [options] [target]
Options:
-help                  print this message
-version               print the version information and exit
-quiet                 be extra quiet
-verbose               be extra verbose
-logfile &lt;file&gt;        use given file for log
-listener &lt;classname&gt;  add an instance of class as a project listener
-buildfile &lt;file&gt;      use given buildfile
-D&lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt;   use value for given property</pre>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>runs Ant using the <code>build.xml</code> file in the current directory, on
the default target.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant -buildfile test.xml</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>runs Ant using the <code>test.xml</code> file in the current directory, on
the default target.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant -buildfile test.xml dist</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>runs Ant using the <code>test.xml</code> file in the current directory, on a
target called <code>dist</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant -buildfile test.xml -Dbuild=build/classes dist</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>runs Ant using the <code>test.xml</code> file in the current directory, on a
target called <code>dist</code>. It also sets the <i>build</i> property to the
value <i>build/classes</i>.</p>
<h3>Running Ant by hand</h3>
<p>When you have installed Ant in the do-it-yourself way, Ant can be started
with:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>java -Dant.home=c:\ant org.apache.tools.ant.Main [options] [target]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions actually do exactly the same as the <code>ant</code>
command. The options and target are the same as when running Ant with the <code>ant</code>
command. This example assumes you have set up your classpath to include
<ul>
<li>ant.jar
<li>jars/classes for your XML parser
<li>the JDK's tools.jar
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="buildfile">Writing a simple buildfile</a></h2>
<p>The buildfile is written in XML. Each buildfile contains one project.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>A project has three attributes:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">name</td>
    <td valign="top">the name of the project.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">default</td>
    <td valign="top">the default target to use when no target is supplied.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">basedir</td>
    <td valign="top">the base directory from which all path calculations are
      done. This attribute might be overridden by setting the &quot;basedir&quot;
      property on forehand. When this is done, it might be ommitted in the
      project tag.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Each project defines one or more targets. A target is a set of tasks you want
to be executed. When starting Ant, you can select which target you want to have
executed. When no target is given, the project's default is used.</p>
<h3>Targets</h3>
<p>A target can depend on other targets. You might have a target for compiling,
for instance, and a target for creating a distributable. You can only build a
distributable when you have compiled first, so the distribute target depends on
the compile target. Ant resolves all these dependencies.</p>
<p>Ant tries to execute the targets in the <i>depends</i> attribute in the order
they appear (from left to right). Keep in mind that it is possible that a target
can get executed earlier when an earlier target depends on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;target name=&quot;A&quot;/&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;B&quot; depends=&quot;A&quot;/&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;C&quot; depends=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;D&quot; depends=&quot;C,B,A&quot;/&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose we want to execute target D. From its <i>depends</i> attribute, you
might think that first target C, then B and then A is executed. Wrong! C depends
on B, and B depends on A, so first A is executed, then B, then C, and finally D.</p>
<p>A target gets executed only once. Even when more targets depend on it (see
the previous example).</p>
<p>A target has also the ability to perform its execution if (or
unless) a property has been set. This allows, for example, better
control on the building process depending on the state of the system
(java version, OS, command line properties, etc...).  To make target
<i>sense</i> this property you should add the <i>if</i> (or
<i>unless</i>) attribute with the name of the property that the target
should react to, for example</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;target name=&quot;build-module-A&quot; if=&quot;module-A-present&quot;/&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;target name=&quot;build-own-fake-module-A&quot; unless=&quot;module-A-present&quot;/&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If no <i>if</i> and no <i>unless</i> attribute is present, the target will 
always be executed.</p>
<p>It is a good practice to place your <a
href="#tstamp">tstamp</a> tasks in a so called initialization target, on which
all other targets depend. Make sure that that target is always the first one in
the depends list of the other targets. In this manual, most initialization targets
have the name "init".</p>
<p>A target has the following attributes:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">name</td>
    <td valign="top">the name of the project.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">depends</td>
    <td valign="top">a comma separated list of names of targets on which this
      target depends.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">if</td>
    <td valign="top">the name of the property that must be set in order for this
      target to execute.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">unless</td>
    <td valign="top">the name of the property that must not be set in order 
      for this target to execute.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">No</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>A task is a piece of code that can be executed.</p>
<p>A task can have multiple attributes (or arguments if you prefer). The value
of an attribute might contain references to a property. These references will be
resolved before the task is executed.</p>
<p>Tasks have a common structure:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;name attribute1=&quot;value1&quot; attribute2=&quot;value2&quot; ... /&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>where name is the name of the task, attribute-x the attribute name, and
value-x the value of this attribute.</p>
<p>There is a set of <a href="#tasks">built in tasks</a>, but it is also very
easy to <a href="#writingowntask">write your own</a>.</p>
<p>All tasks share a <code>taskname</code> attribute. The value of
this attribute will be used in the logging messages generated by
Ant.</p>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>A project can have a set of properties. These might be set in the buildfile
by the <a href="#property">property task</a>, or might be set outside Ant. A
property has a name and a value. Properties might be used in in the value of
task attributes. This is done by placing the property name between
&quot;${&quot; and &quot;}&quot; in the attribute value.</p>
<p>If there is a property called &quot;builddir&quot; with the value
&quot;build&quot;, then this could be used in an attribute like this: &quot;${builddir}/classes&quot;.
This is resolved as &quot;build/classes&quot;.</p>
<h3>Token Filters</h3>
<p>A project can have a set of tokens that might be automatically expanded if
found when a file is copied, when the filtering-copy behavior is selected in the
tasks that support this. These might be set in the buildfile
by the <a href="#filter">filter task</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this can be a very harmful behavior, the tokens in the files <b>must</b>
be of the form<i> @token@</i> where <i>token</i> is the token name that is set
in the filter task. This token syntax matches the syntax of other build systems
that perform such filtering and remains sufficiently orthogonal to most
programming and scripting languages, as well with documentation systems.</p>
<p>Note: in case a token with the format @token@ if found in a file but no
filter is associated with that token, no changes take place. So, no escaping
method is present, but as long as you choose appropriate names for your tokens,
this should not cause problems.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;project name=&quot;foo&quot; default=&quot;dist&quot; basedir=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;target name=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tstamp/&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;build&quot; value=&quot;build&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;dist&quot;  value=&quot;dist&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;filter token=&quot;version&quot; value=&quot;1.0.3&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;filter token=&quot;year&quot; value=&quot;2000&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;prepare&quot; depends=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
    &lt;mkdir dir=&quot;${build}&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;compile&quot; depends=&quot;prepare&quot;&gt;
    &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;${src}&quot; destdir=&quot;${build}&quot; filtering=&quot;on&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;dist&quot; depends=&quot;compile&quot;&gt;
    &lt;mkdir dir=&quot;${dist}/lib&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;jar jarfile=&quot;${dist}/lib/foo${DSTAMP}.jar&quot;
     basedir=&quot;${build}&quot; items=&quot;com&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;clean&quot; depends=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
    &lt;deltree dir=&quot;${build}&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;deltree dir=&quot;${dist}&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="path">PATH like structures</a></h3>
<p>You can specify PATH and CLASSPATH variables using both
&quot;:&quot; and &quot;;&quot; as separator characters, Ant will
convert it to the correct character of the current operating
system.</p>
<p>Wherever PATH like values need to be specified a nested element can
be used. This takes the general form of</p>
<pre>
    &lt;classpath&gt;
      &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${classpath}&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;pathelement location=&quot;lib/helper.jar&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/classpath&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <code>location</code> attribute specifies a single file or
directory relative to the project's base directory (or an absolute
filename), while the <code>path</code> attribute accepts &quot;:&quot;
or &quot;;&quot; separated lists of locations. The <code>path</code>
attribute is intended to be used with predefined paths - in any other
case multiple elements with <code>location</code> attributes should be
preferred.</p>
<p>As a shortcut the surrounding PATH element supports path and
location attributes of its own, so</p>
<pre>
    &lt;classpath&gt;
      &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${classpath}&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/classpath&gt;
</pre>
<p>can be abreviated to</p>
<pre>
    &lt;classpath path=&quot;${classpath}&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<h2><a name="directorybasedtasks">Directory based tasks</a></h2>
<p>Some tasks use directory trees for the task they perform. For instance, the <a
href="#javac">Javac task</a> which works upon a directory tree with .java files.
Sometimes it can be very useful to work on a subset of that directory tree. This
section describes how you can select a subset of such a directory tree.</p>
<p>Ant gives you two ways to create a subset, both of which can be used at the same
time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only include files/directories that match at least one pattern of a set of
    patterns</li>
  <li>Exclude files/directories that match at least one pattern a set of
    patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>When both inclusion and exclusion are used, only files/directories that match
the include patterns, and don't match the exclude patterns are used.</p>
<p>Patterns can be specified inside the buildfile via task attributes or
nested elements and via external files. Each line of the external file
is taken as pattern that is added to the list of include or exclude 
patterns.</p>
<h3>Patterns</h3>
<p>As described earlier, patterns are used for the inclusion and exclusion.
These patterns look very much like the patterns used in DOS and UNIX:</p>
<p>'*' matches zero or more characters, '?' matches one character.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>'*.java' matches '.java', 'x.java' and 'FooBar.java', but not 'FooBar.xml'
(does not end with '.java').</p>
<p>'?.java' matches 'x.java', 'A.java', but not '.java' or 'xyz.java' (both
don't have one character before '.java').</p>
<p>Combinations of '*'s and '?'s are allowed.</p>
<p>Matching is done per-directory. This means that first the first directory in
the pattern is matched against the first directory in the path to match. Then
the second directories are matched, and so on. E.g. when we have the pattern '/?abc/*/*.java'
and the path '/xabc/foobar/test.java', then first '?abc' is matched with 'xabc',
then '*' is matched with 'foobar' and finally '*.java' is matched with 'test.java'.
They all match so the path matches the pattern.</p>
<p>Too make things a bit more flexible, we add one extra feature, which makes it
possible to match multiple directory levels. This can be used to match a
complete directory tree, or a file anywhere in the directory tree. To do this, '**'
must be used as the name of a directory. When '**' is used as the name of a
directory in the pattern, it matches zero or more directories. For instance:
'/test/**' matches all files/directories under '/test/', such as '/test/x.java',
or '/test/foo/bar/xyz.html', but not '/xyz.xml'.</p>
<p>There is one &quot;shorthand&quot;, if a pattern ends with '/' or '\', then '**'
is appended. E.g. &quot;mypackage/test/&quot; is interpreted as were it &quot;mypackage/test/**&quot;.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">**/CVS/*</td>
    <td valign="top">Matches all files in CVS directories, that can be located
      anywhere in the directory tree.
      <p>Matches:</p>
      <p>CVS/Repository<br>
      org/apache/CVS/Entries<br>
      org/apache/jakarta/tools/ant/CVS/Entries</p>
      <p>But not:</p>
      <p>org/apache/CVS/foo/bar/Entries ('foo/bar/' part does not match)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">org/apache/jakarta/**</td>
    <td valign="top">Matches all files in the org/apache/jakarta directory tree.
      <p>Matches:</p>
      <p>org/apache/jakarta/tools/ant/docs/index.html<br>
      org/apache/jakarta/test.xml</p>
      <p>But not:</p>
      <p>org/apache/xyz.java ('jakarta'/' part is missing)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">org/apache/**/CVS/*</td>
    <td valign="top">Matches all files in CVS directories, that are located
      anywhere in the directory tree under org/apache.
      <p>Matches:</p>
      <p>org/apache/CVS/Entries<br>
      org/apache/jakarta/tools/ant/CVS/Entries</p>
      <p>But not:</p>
      <p>org/apache/CVS/foo/bar/Entries ('foo/bar/' part does not match)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">**/test/**</td>
    <td valign="top">Matches all files which have a directory 'test' in their
      path, including 'test' as a filename.</td>
  </tr>

<p>When these patterns are used in inclusion and exclusion, you have a powerful
way to select just the files you want.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>  &lt;copydir src=&quot;${src}&quot;
           dest=&quot;${dist}&quot;
           includes=&quot;**/images/*&quot;
           excludes=&quot;**/*.gif&quot; /&gt;</pre>
<p>This copies all files in directories called &quot;images&quot;, that are
located in the directory tree &quot;${src}&quot; to the destination &quot;${dist}&quot;,
but excludes all &quot;*.gif&quot; files from the copy.</p>
<p> This example can also be expressed using nested elements as
<pre>  &lt;copydir src=&quot;${src}&quot;
           dest=&quot;${dist}&quot;&gt;
    &lt;include name=&quot;**/images/*&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*.gif&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/copydir&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Default Excludes</h3>
<p>There are a set of definitions which are excluded by default from all directory based tasks.
They are:
<pre>        &quot;**/*~&quot;,
        &quot;**/#*#&quot;,
        &quot;**/%*%&quot;,
        &quot;**/CVS&quot;,
        &quot;**/CVS/*&quot;,
        &quot;**/.cvsignore&quot;
</pre>
If you do not want these default excludes applied, you may disable them with the 
<code>defaultexcludes=&quot;no&quot;</code> attribute.</p>

<h2><a name="ant">Ant</a></h2>
<h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
<p>Runs Ant on a supplied buildfile. This can be used to build subprojects.</p>
<p>When the <i>antfile</i> attribute is omitted, the file &quot;build.xml&quot;
in the supplied directory (<i>dir</i> attribute) is used.</p>
<p>If no target attribute is supplied, the default target of the new project is
used.</p>
<p>The properties of the current project will be available in the new project.
These properties will override the properties that are set in the new project.
(See also the <a href="#property">properties task</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="available">Available</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sets a property if a resource is available at runtime. This resource can be a
file resource, a class in classpath or a JVM system resource.</p>
<p>The value part of the properties being set is <i>true</i> if the resource is
present, otherwise, the property is not set.</p>
<p>Normally, this task is used to set properties that are useful to avoid target
execution depending on system parameters.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="chmod">Chmod</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Changes the permissions of a file or all files inside a specified directory. Right now it has efect only under Unix.
The permissions are also UNIX style, like the argument for the chmod command.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files whose permissions are changed. This can be
done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i>
attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you specify the files you want to
have included by using patterns. The <i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify
the files you want to have excluded. This is also done with patterns. And
finally with the <i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. The patterns are
relative to the <i>dir</i> directory.</p>

<h2><a name="fixcrlf">FixCRLF</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Adjusts a text file to local.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files that are being adjusted. This can be
done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i>
attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you specify the files you want to
have included by using patterns. The <i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify
the files you want to have excluded. This is also done with patterns. And
finally with the <i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. The patterns are
relative to the <i>src</i> directory.</p>

<h2><a name="jar">Jar</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Jars a set of files.</p>
<p>The <i>basedir</i> attribute is the reference directory from where to jar.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files that are being jarred. This can be
done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i>
attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you specify the files you want to
have included by using patterns. The <i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify
the files you want to have excluded. This is also done with patterns. And
finally with the <i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. The patterns are
relative to the <i>basedir</i> directory.</p>
<p>The <i>includes</i>, <i>excludes</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i> attributes
replace the <i>items</i> and <i>ignore</i> attributes. The following explains
how the deprecated <i>items</i> and <i>ignore</i> attribute behave.</p>
<p>When &quot;*&quot; is used for <i>items</i>, all files in the basedir, and
its subdirectories, will be jarred. Otherwise all the files and directories
mentioned in the items list will jarred. When a directory is specified, then all
files within it are also jarred.</p>
<p>With the <i>ignore</i> attribute, you can specify files or directories to
ignore. These files will not be jarred. The items in the <i>ignore</i> attribute
override the items in the <i>items</i> attribute. The names specified in the <i>ignore</i>
attribute are just names, they do not contain any path information!</p>

<h2><a name="java">Java</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Executes a Java class within the running (Ant) VM or forks another VM if
specified.</p>
<p>Be careful that the executed class doesn't call System.exit(), because it
will terminate the VM and thus Ant. In case this happens, it's highly suggested
that you set the fork attribute so that System.exit() stops the other VM and not
the one that is currently running Ant.</p>

source files to compile. Only Java files that have no corresponding class file
or where the class file is older than the java file will be compiled.</p>
<p>Files in the source tree, that are no java files, are copied to the
destination directory, allowing support files to be located properly in the
classpath.</p>
<p>The directory structure of the source tree should follow the package
hierarchy.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files that are being compiled/copied.
This can be done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i>
attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you specify the files you want to
have included by using patterns. The <i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify
the files you want to have excluded. This is also done with patterns. And
finally with the <i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. The patterns are
relative to the <i>srcdir</i> directory.</p>
<p>It is possible to use different compilers. This can be selected with the
&quot;build.compiler&quot; property. There are three choices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>classic (the standard compiler of JDK 1.1/1.2)</li>
  <li>modern (the new compiler of JDK 1.3)</li>
  <li>jikes (the <a
    href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/project">Jikes</a>
    compiler)</li>
</ul>
<p>For JDK 1.1/1.2 is classic the default. For JDK 1.3 is modern the default.</p>

<h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>
Being a directory based task, Javac supports the <code>&lt;include&gt;</code> and 
<code>&lt;exclude&gt;</code> nested elements common to a number of Ant tasks. Javac also supports a 
nested <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> element. This is used to specify multiple source paths. 
Multiple <code>src</code> elements may be present and each specifies a source path which will be 
searched by Javac for classes to compile.

<h4>src, classpath, bootclasspath and extdirs</h4>
<p><code>Javac</code>'s <em>srcdir</em>, <em>classpath</em>,
<em>bootclasspath</em> and <em>extdirs</em> attributes are <a
href="#path">PATH like structure</a> and can also be set via nested
<em>src</em>, <em>classpath</em>, <em>bootclasspath</em> and
<em>extdirs</em> elements respectively.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>  &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;${src}&quot;
         destdir=&quot;${build}&quot;
         classpath=&quot;xyz.jar&quot;
         debug=&quot;on&quot;
  /&gt;</pre>
<p>compiles all .java files under the directory <code>${src}</code>, and stores
the .class files in the directory <code>${build}</code>. It also copies the non-java
files from the tree under <code>${src}</code> to the tree under <code>${build}</code>.
The classpath used contains <code>xyz.jar</code>, and debug information is on.</p>
<pre>  &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;${src}&quot;
         destdir=&quot;${build}&quot;
         includes=&quot;mypackage/p1/**,mypackage/p2/**&quot;
         excludes=&quot;mypackage/p1/testpackage/**&quot;
         classpath=&quot;xyz.jar&quot;
         debug=&quot;on&quot;
  /&gt;</pre>
<p>compiles .java files under the directory <code>${src}</code>, and stores the
.class files in the directory <code>${build}</code>. It also copies the non-java
files from the tree under <code>${src}</code> to the tree under <code>${build}</code>.
The classpath used contains <code>xyz.jar</code>, and debug information is on.
Only files under <code>mypackage/p1</code> and <code>mypackage/p2</code> are
used. Files in the <code>mypackage/p1/testpackage</code> directory are excluded
form compilation and copy.</p>

<pre>  &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;${src}:${src2}&quot;
         destdir=&quot;${build}&quot;
         includes=&quot;mypackage/p1/**,mypackage/p2/**&quot;
         excludes=&quot;mypackage/p1/testpackage/**&quot;
         classpath=&quot;xyz.jar&quot;
         debug=&quot;on&quot;
  /&gt;</pre>

<p>is the same as the previous example with the addition of a second source path, defined by
the propery <code>src2</code>. This can also be represented using nested elements as follows

<pre>  &lt;javac destdir=&quot;${build}&quot;
         classpath=&quot;xyz.jar&quot;
         debug=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
    &lt;src path=&quot;${src}&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;src path=&quot;${src2}&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;include name=&quot;mypackage/p1/**,mypackage/p2/**&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;exclude name=&quot;mypackage/p1/testpackage/**&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/javac&gt;</pre>

<h2><a name="javadoc">Javadoc/Javadoc2</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Generates code documentation using the javadoc tool.</p>
<p>The source directory will be recursively scanned for Java source files to process
but only those matching the inclusion rules will be passed to the javadoc tool. This
allows wildcards to be used to choose between package names, reducing verbosity
and management costs over time. This task, however, has no notion of
&quot;changed&quot; files, unlike the <a href="#javac">javac</a> task. This means
all packages will be processed each time this task is run. In general, however,
this task is used much less frequently.</p>
<p>This task works seamlessly between different javadoc versions (1.1 and 1.2),
with the obvious restriction that the 1.2 attributes will be ignored if run in a
1.1 VM.</p>
<p>NOTE: since javadoc calls System.exit(), javadoc cannot be run inside the
same VM as ant without breaking functionality. For this reason, this task 
always forks the VM. This overhead is not significant since javadoc is normally a heavy
application and will be called infrequently.</p>
<p>NOTE: the packagelist attribute allows you to specify the list of packages to 
document outside of the Ant file. It's a much better practice to include everything 
inside the build.xml file. This option was added in order to make it easier to 
migrate from regular makefiles, where you would use this option of javadoc. 
The packages listed in packagelist are not checked, so the task performs even 
if some packages are missing or broken. Use this option if you wish to convert from 
an existing makefile. Once things are running you should then switch to the regular 
notation. 

<p>DEPRECATION: the javadoc2 task simply points to the javadoc task and it's
there for back compatibility reasons. Since this task will be removed in future
versions, you are strongly encouraged to use <a href="#javadoc">javadoc</a>
instead.</p>

<h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>
Two parameters of the Javadoc task may be specified as nested elements of the
Javadoc task element: link and group.
When present, there can be any number of each of these elements.
They perform the same role as the link, linkoffline and
group attributes. You can use either syntax (or both at once), but with the  nested 
elements you can easily specify multiple occurrences of the arguments.
<h4>link</h4>
Create link to javadoc output at the given URL
<h4>Parameters</h4>

<table width="60%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>

    <td valign="top">href</td>
    <td valign="top">The URL for the external documentation you wish to link to</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">offline</td>
    <td valign="top">True if this link is not available online at the time of 
                     generating the documentation</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">packagelistLoc</td>
    <td valign="top">The location to the directory containing the package-list file for
                     the external documentation</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">Only if the offline attribute is true</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  
<h4>groups</h4>
Separates packages on the overview page into whatever groups you specify,
one group per table.

<table width="60%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<h4>sourcepath, classpath and bootclasspath</h4>
<p><code>Javadoc</code>'s <em>sourcepath</em>, <em>classpath</em> and
<em>bootclasspath</em> attributes are <a href="#path">PATH like
structure</a> and can also be set via nested <em>sourcepath</em>,
<em>classpath</em> and <em>bootclasspath</em> elements
respectively.</p>

<h2><a name="keysubst">KeySubst</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Performs keyword substitution in the source file, and writes the result to
the destination file.</p>
<p>Keys in the source file are of the form ${keyname}. The <i>keys</i> attribute
contains key/value pairs. When a key is found in the <i>keys</i> attribute, then
&quot;${keyname}&quot; is replaced by the corresponding value.</p>
<p>The <i>keys</i> attribute is of the form
&quot;name1=value1*name2=value2*name3=value3&quot;. The '*' is called the
separator, which might we changed with the <i>sep</i> attribute.</p>
<p>Note: the source file and destination file may not be the same.</p>

<h2><a name="property">Property</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sets a property (by name and value), or set of properties (from file or
resource) in the project.</p>
<p>When a property was set by the user, or was a property in a parent project
(that started this project with the <a href="#ant">ant task</a>), then this
property cannot be set, and will be ignored. This means that properties set
outside the current project always override the properties of the current
project.</p>
<p>There are three ways to set properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By supplying both the <i>name</i> and <i>value</i> attribute.</li>
  <li>By setting the <i>file</i> attribute with the filename of the property
    file to load. This property file has the format as defined by the file used
    in the class java.util.Properties.</li>
  <li>By setting the <i>resource</i> attribute with the resource name of the
    property file to load. This property file has the format as defined by the
    file used in the class java.util.Properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although combinations of the three ways are possible, only one should be used
at a time. Problems might occur with the order in which properties are set, for
instance.</p>
<p>The value part of the properties being set, might contain references to other
properties. These references are resolved at the time these properties are set.
This also holds for properties loaded from a property file.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>

    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>

    <td valign="top">name</td>
    <td valign="top">the name of the property to set.</td>
    <td valign="top" align="center">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">value</td>
    <td valign="top">the value of the property.</td>
    <td valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="3">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">resource</td>
    <td valign="top">the resource name of the property file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">file</td>
    <td valign="top">the filename of the property file .</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>  &lt;property name=&quot;foo.dist&quot; value=&quot;dist&quot; /&gt;</pre>
<p>sets the property <code>foo.dist</code> to the value &quot;dist&quot;.</p>
<pre>  &lt;property file=&quot;foo.properties&quot; /&gt;</pre>
<p>reads a set of properties from a file called &quot;foo.properties&quot;.</p>
<pre>  &lt;property resource=&quot;foo.properties&quot; /&gt;</pre>
<p>reads a set of properties from a resource called &quot;foo.properties&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that you can reference a global properties file for all of your Ant
builds using the following:
<pre>  &lt;property file=&quot;${user.home}/.ant-global.properties&quot; /&gt;</pre>
<p>since the &quot;user.home&quot; property is defined by the Java virtual machine
to be your home directory.  This technique is more appropriate for Unix than 
Windows since the notion of a home directory doesn't exist on Windows.  On the
JVM that I tested, the home directory on Windows is &quot;C:\&quot;.  Different JVM
implementations may use other values for the home directory on Windows.

<h2><a name="tar">Tar</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Creates a tar archive.</p>
<p>The <i>basedir</i> attribute is the reference directory from where to tar.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files that are being tarred. This can be
done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i>
attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you specify the files you want to
have included by using patterns. The <i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify
the files you want to have excluded. This is also done with patterns. And
finally with the <i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. The patterns are
relative to the <i>basedir</i> directory.</p>
<p>The <i>includes</i>, <i>excludes</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i> attributes
replace the <i>items</i> and <i>ignore</i> attributes. The following explains
how the deprecated <i>items</i> and <i>ignore</i> attribute behave.</p>
<p>When &quot;*&quot; is used for <i>items</i>, all files in the basedir, and
its subdirectories, will be tarred. Otherwise all the files and directories
mentioned in the items list will tarred. When a directory is specified, then all
files within it are also tarred.</p>
<p>With the <i>ignore</i> attribute, you can specify files or directories to
ignore. These files will not be tarred. The items in the <i>ignore</i> attribute
override the items in the <i>items</i> attribute. The names specified in the <i>ignore</i>
attribute are just names, they do not contain any path information!</p>
<p>Note that this task does not perform compression. You might want to use the <a href="#gzip">GZip</a>
task to come up with a .tar.gz package.</p>

<h2><a name="zip">Zip</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Creates a zipfile.</p>
<p>The <i>basedir</i> attribute is the reference directory from where to zip.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files that are being zipped. This can be
done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i>
attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you specify the files you want to
have included by using patterns. The <i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify
the files you want to have excluded. This is also done with patterns. And
finally with the <i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. The patterns are
relative to the <i>basedir</i> directory.</p>
<p>The <i>includes</i>, <i>excludes</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i> attributes
replace the <i>items</i> and <i>ignore</i> attributes. The following explains
how the deprecated <i>items</i> and <i>ignore</i> attribute behave.</p>
<p>When &quot;*&quot; is used for <i>items</i>, all files in the basedir, and
its subdirectories, will be zipped. Otherwise all the files and directories
mentioned in the items list will zipped. When a directory is specified, then all
files within it are also zipped.</p>
<p>With the <i>ignore</i> attribute, you can specify files or directories to
ignore. These files will not be zipped. The items in the <i>ignore</i> attribute
override the items in the <i>items</i> attribute. The names specified in the <i>ignore</i>
attribute are just names, they do not contain any path information!</p>

<h2><a name="buildevents">Build Events</a></h2>
Ant is capable of generating build events as it performs the tasks necessary to build a project. 
Listeners can be attached to ant to receive these events. This capability could be used, for example,
to connect Ant to a GUI or to integrate Ant with an IDE. 

<p>To use build events you need to create an ant <code>Project</code> object. You can then call the 
<code>addBuildListener</code> method to add your listener to the project. Your listener must implement
the <code>org.apache.tools.antBuildListener</code> interface. The listener will receive BuildEvents 
for the following events
<ul>
<li>Build started
<li>Build finished
<li>Target started
<li>Target finished
<li>Task started
<li>Task finished
<li>Message logged
</ul>

If you wish to attach a listener from the command line you may use the -listener option. For example
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant -listener org.apache.tools.ant.XmlLogger</pre>
</blockquote>
will run ant with a listener which generates an XML representaion of the build progress. This 
listener is included with ant as is the default listener which generates the logging to standard
output.


<hr>
<h2><a name="writingowntask">Writing your own task</a></h2>
<p>It is very easy to write your own task:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a Java class that extends <code>org.apache.tools.ant.Task</code>.</li>
  <li>For each attribute, write a setter method. The setter method must be a 
    <code>public void</code> method that takes a single argument. The
    name of the method must begin with &quot;set&quot;, followed by the
    attribute name, with the first character in uppercase, and the rest in
    lowercase. The type of the attribute can be <code>String</code>, any 
    primitive type, <code>Class</code>, <code>File</code> (in which case the 
    value of the attribute is interpreted relative to the project's basedir) 
    or any other type that has a constructor with a single <code>String</code>
    argument</li>
  <li>If your task has enumerated attributes, you should consider using
    a subclass of org.apache.tools.ant.EnumeratedAttribute as argument
    to your setter method. See org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.FixCRLF for
    an example.</li>
  <li>If the task should support character data, write a <code>public void 
    addText(String)</code> method.</li>
  <li>For each nested element, write a create or add method. A create method 
    must be a <code>public</code> method that takes no arguments and returns 
    an Object type. The name of the create method must begin with 
    &quot;create&quot;, followed by the element name. An add method must be 
    a <code>public void</code> method that takes a single argument of an 
    Object type with a no argument constructor. The name of the add method 
    must begin with &quot;add&quot;, followed by the element name.
  <li>Write a <code>public void execute</code> method, with no arguments, that
    throws a <code>BuildException</code>. This method implements the task
    itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to know that Ant first calls the setters for the attributes
it encounters for a specific task in the buildfile, before it executes is.</p>
<p>Let's write our own task, that prints a message on the System.out stream. The
task has one attribute called &quot;message&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>package com.mydomain;

import org.apache.tools.ant.BuildException;
import org.apache.tools.ant.Task;

public class MyVeryOwnTask extends Task {
  private String msg;

  // The method executing the task
  public void execute() throws BuildException {
    System.out.println(msg);
  }

  // The setter for the &quot;message&quot; attribute
  public void setMessage(String msg) {
    this.msg = msg;
  }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It's really this simple;-)</p>
<p>Adding your task to the system is rather simple too:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure the class that implements your task is in the classpath when
    starting Ant.</li>
  <li>In your initialization target, add a <i>taskdef</i> task. This actually adds
    your task to the system.</li>
  <li>Use your task in the rest of the buildfile.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

&lt;project name=&quot;OwnTaskExample&quot; default=&quot;main&quot; basedir=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;target name=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
    &lt;taskdef name=&quot;mytask&quot; classname=&quot;com.mydomain.MyVeryOwnTask&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;main&quot; depends=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
    &lt;mytask message=&quot;Hello World! MyVeryOwnTask works!&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to add a task (more permanently), is to add the task name and
implementing class name to the <code>default.properties</code> file in the <code>org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs</code>
package. Then you can use it as if it were a built in task.</p>

<h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
<p>Compiles a <a href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/netrexx">NetRexx</a>
source tree within the running (Ant) VM.</p>
<p>The source and destination directory will be recursively scanned for
NetRexx source files to compile.  Only NetRexx files that have no corresponding
class file or where the class file is older than the java file will be compiled.</p>
<p>Files in the source tree are copied to the destination directory,
allowing support files to be located properly in the classpath. The source 
files are copied because the NetRexx compiler cannot produce class files in a
specific directory via parameters</p>
<p>The directory structure of the source tree should follow the package
hierarchy.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files that are being compiled/copied.
This can be done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and
<i>defaultexcludes</i> attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you 
specify the files you want to have included by using patterns. The 
<i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify the files you want to have 
excluded.  This is also done with patterns.  And finally with the 
<i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. The
patterns are relative to the <i>srcDir</i> directory.</p>

<h2><a name="renameexts">RenameExtensions</a></h2>
<h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
<p>Renames files in the <code>srcDir</code> directory ending with the
<code>fromExtension</code> string so that they end with the 
<code>toExtension</code> string. Files are only replaced if 
<code>replace</code> is true
</p>
<p>See the section on 
<a href="#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. The
patterns are relative to the <i>srcDir</i> directory.</p>
