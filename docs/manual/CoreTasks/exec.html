<h2><a name="exec">Exec</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Executes a system command. When the <i>os</i> attribute is specified, then
the command is only executed when Ant is run on one of the specified operating
systems.</p>

<h4>Cygwin Users</h4>
<p>In general the &lt;exec&gt; task will not understand paths such as /bin/sh for 
the executable parameter. This is because the Java VM in which Ant is running is a 
Windows executable and is not aware of Cygwin conventions.
</p>
 
<h4>OpenVMS Users</h4>
<p>The command specified using <code>executable</code> and
<code>&lt;arg&gt;</code> elements is executed exactly as specified
inside a temporary DCL script.  This has some implications:
<ul>
<li>paths have to be written in VMS style</li>
<li>if your <code>executable</code> points to a DCL script remember to
prefix it with an <code>@</code>-sign
(e.g. <code>executable="@[FOO]BAR.COM"</code>), just as you would in a
DCL script</li>
</ul>
For <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> to work in an environment with a Java VM
older than version 1.4.1-2 it is also <i>required</i> that the logical
<code>JAVA$FORK_SUPPORT_CHDIR</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> in
the job table (see the <i>JDK Release Notes</i>).</p>

<p>Please note that the Java VM provided by HP doesn't follow OpenVMS'
conventions of exit codes.  If you run a Java VM with this task, the
task may falsely claim that an error occured (or silently ignore an
error).  Don't use this task to run <code>JAVA.EXE</code>, use a
<code>&lt;java&gt;</code> task with the <code>fork</code> attribute
set to <code>true</code> instead as this task will follow the VM's
interpretation of exit codes.</p>

        being able to execute scripts, rather than their associated

<h3>Errors and return codes</h3>
By default the return code of a &lt;exec&gt; is ignored; when you set 
<code>failonerror="true"</code> then any return code signaling failure
(OS specific) causes the build to fail. Alternatively, you can set
<code>resultproperty</code> to the name of a property and have it assigned to
the result code (barring immutability, of course).
<p>
If the attempt to start the program fails with an OS dependent error code,
then &lt;exec&gt; halts the build unless <code>failifexecutionfails</code>
is set to <code>false</code>. You can use that to run a program if it exists, but
otherwise do nothing.
<p>
What do those error codes mean? Well, they are OS dependent. On Windows
boxes you have to look in include\error.h in your windows compiler or wine files;
error code 2 means 'no such program', which usually means it is not on the path.
Any time you see such an error from any ant task, it is usually not an ant bug,
but some configuration problem on your machine.  

<h3>Examples</h3>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;exec executable=&quot;emacs&quot;&gt;
  &lt;env key=&quot;DISPLAY&quot; value=&quot;:1.0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/exec&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>starts <code>emacs</code> on display 1 of the X Window System.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;exec ... &gt;
  &lt;env key=&quot;PATH&quot; path=&quot;${java.library.path}:${basedir}/bin&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/exec&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>adds <code>${basedir}/bin</code> to the <code>PATH</code> of the
system command.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;property name="browser" location="C:/Programme/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe"/&gt;
&lt;property name="file" location="ant/docs/manual/index.html"/&gt;

&lt;exec executable="${browser}" spawn="true"&gt;
    &lt;arg value="${file}"/&gt;
&lt;/exec&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Starts the <i>${browser}</i> with the specified <i>${file}</i> and end the
ant process. The browser will let be open.</p>


<p><b>Note:</b> Although it may work for you to specify arguments using 
a simple arg-element and separate them by spaces it may fail if you switch to
a newer version of the JDK. JDK &lt; 1.2 will pass these as separate arguments
to the program you are calling, JDK &gt;= 1.2 will pass them as a single 
argument and cause most calls to fail.</p>
<p><b>Note2:</b> If you are using Ant on Windows and a new DOS-Window pops up
for every command which is executed this may be a problem of the JDK you are using.
This problem may occur with all JDK's &lt; 1.2.</p>
<p>
<b>Timeouts: </b> If a timeout is specified, when it is reached the 
sub process is killed and a message printed to the log. The return
value of the execution will be "-1", which will halt the build if
<tt>failonerror=true</tt>, but be ignored otherwise.
