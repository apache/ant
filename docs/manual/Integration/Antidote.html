    <H2>Introduction</H2> 

    <P>The purpose of this document is to communicate the overall
    structure and design patters used in Antidote, the GUI for
    Ant. This document is a work in progress, as well as a living
    document, and it is most likely not be in full synchronization with
    the source code. Therefore, if there is any doubt, view the source
    ;-)</P>

    <H2>Overview</H2>
    
    <P>The Antidote architecture design aims to provide a high level
    of modularity and extensibility. Ideally the components of
    Antidote will be able to be assembled in different configurations
    to provide the type of application or plug-in desired.</P>

    <P>To acheive this modularity, a high level of decoupling is
    necessary. The standard UI design approach of providing separation
    of view (presentation) from model (data) is applied, leveraging
    the built-in Ant data model where possible, as well as the
    predifined Swing model interfaces. Furthermore, the architecture
    is highly event driven, whereby modules communicate via a shared
    communications channel.</P>
    
    <P>To a large extent, the configuration of application modules is
    driven by localized configuration files, allowing new modules or
    data views to be added, as well as providing multi-language
    support.</P>

    <P>The diagram below conveys a high altitude view of the
    application's structure. As the application grows, new components
    will be plugged in to what will be described as the <TT>EventBus</TT>.

    <H2>Event Bus</H2>

    <P>The backbone of the application is the <TT>EventBus</TT>. Any
    component of the application can post events to the
    <TT>EventBus</TT>. Components that wish to receive events are
    called <TT>BusMember</TT>s.</P>

    <P>The <TT>EventBus</TT> will dispatch any object of type
    <TT>java.util.Event</TT>, which means that Ant <TT>BuildEvent</TT>
    objects, as well as <TT>AWTEvent</TT> objects can be posted (if desired). A
    new class of events called <TT>AntEvent</TT> is defined for Antidote
    specific events, which have the additional capability of being
    cancelled mid-dispatch.</P>

    <P>Each <TT>BusMember</TT> must provide a <TT>BusFilter</TT> instance,
    which is the members' means of telling the bus which
    events it is interested in. This allows a <TT>BusMember</TT> to,
    say, only receive <TT>AntEvent</TT> objects.</P>

    <P>When a <TT>BusMember</TT> registers itself with the
    <TT>EventBus</TT>, it must provide a (so called) <I>interrupt
    level</I> which is a integer value defining a relative ordering
    for dispatching <TT>EventObject</TT>s to <TT>BusMember</TT>s. The
    purpose of this is to allow certain <TT>BusMember</TT> instances
    to see an event before others, and in the case of <TT>AntEvent</TT
    objects, keep the event from propogating onward. The
    <TT>EventBus</TT> class defines the interrupt level constants
    <TT>VETOING=1</TT>, <TT>MONITORING=5</TT>, and <TT>RESPONDING=10</TT> to
    help define categories of members. The implied purpose being that:
    <UL>

      <LI><TT>VETOING</TT>: Listens for certain types of events, and
      may process them in a non-default manner to determine if the
      event should be cancelled before being dispatched to the
      <TT>RESPONDING</TT> group. 

      <LI><TT>MONITORING</TT>: Just listens for events, like a logger
      or status monitor.</LI>

      <LI><TT>RESPONDING</TT>: Process events in a default manner,
      knowing that the event has passed any <TT>VETOING</TT> members.</LI>

    </UL>

    Within a specific interrupt level, the order in which members will
    receive events is undefied. A <TT>BusMember</TT> may be registered
    at a level that is +/- of one of the defined levels, as long as it
    follows the constraint <TT>MONITORING <= interruptLevel <=
    MAX_INTERRUPT</TT>.</P>


    <H2>Actions and ActionManager</H2>

    <P>Extensive use of the <TT>javax.swing.Action</TT> interface is
    made for defining the set of menu and tool bar options that are
    available. The configuration file <TT>action.properties</TT>
    exists to define what should appear in the menu and toolbar, how
    it is displayed, and the <TT>Action</TT> command name that is
    dispatched when the user invokes that action. A class called
    <TT>ActionManager</TT> exists for not only processing the
    configuration file, but also for dispatching invoked action events
    to the <TT>EventBus</TT>, and for controlling the enabled state of
    an <TT>Action</TT>. When a new menu item or toolbar button is
    desired, first it is added to the <TT>action.properties</TT> file,
    and then the code to respond to it is added to the
    <TT>EventResponder</TT> (see below).


    <H2>Commands and EventResponder</H2> 

    <P>At some point in the stages of event processing, an event may
    require the data model to be modified, or some other task be
    performed. The <TT>Command</TT> interface is defined to classify
    code which performs some task or operation. This is distinct from
    an <TT>Action</TT>, which is a user request for an operation. A
    <TT>Command</TT> class is the encapsulation of the operation
    itself.</P>

    <P>When an <TT>Action</TT> generates an <TT>ActionEvent</TT>, the
    event is posted to the <TT>EventBus</TT> which delivers the event
    to all interested <TT>BusMember</TT>s. It eventually makes it to
    the <TT>EventResponder</TT> instance (registered at the
    <TT>RESPONDING</TT> interrupt level), which is responsible for
    translating specific events into <TT>Command</TT> objects, and
    then executing the <TT>Command</TT> object. For example, when the
    user selects the "Open..." menu option, an <TT>ActionEvent</TT> is
    generated by the Swing <TT>MenuItem</TT> class, which is then
    posted to the <TT>EventBus</TT> by the <TT>ActionManager</TT>. The
    <TT>ActionEvent</TT> is delivered to the <TT>EventResponder</TT>,
    which converts the <TT>ActionEvent</TT> into a <TT>Command</TT>
    instance. The <TT>EventResponder</TT> then calls the method
    <TT>Command.execute()</TT> to invoke the command (which displays a
    dialog for selecting a file to open).</P>

    <P>When adding new <TT>Action</TT>s or general tasks to the
    application, a <TT>Command</TT> object should be created to
    encapsulate the behavior. This includes most operations which
    modify the state of the data model.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this encapsulation is to allow the clean
    separation of making a request, and servicing a request. Due to
    various conditions in the application state, the actualy response
    to a request may change, as well as who services it. This
    design approach facilitates that.</P>

    <H2>Data Model and Views</H2>

    <P><I>NB: This part of the architecture is not fleshed out very well. There
    needs to be a discussion of the degree to which the Antidote development
    should be able to impose changes on the Ant data model, and to what level
    that model should be mirrored in the Antidote code base. The coupling
    between them should be kept low, and at the same time changes to one should
    affect the other minimally. Still, features like property change events and
    bean introspection (or BeanInfo) may be needed to be added to the Ant data
    model. Right now the data model is encapsulated in the package
    <TT>org.apache.tools.ant.gui.acs</TT> (where "<TT>acs</TT>" stands for "Ant
    Construction Set").</I></P>

    <H2>Application Context</H2>

    <P>In order to keep the coupling amoung application modules to a
    minimum, a single point of reference is needed for coordination
    and data sharing. The class <TT>AppContext</TT> is the catch-all
    class for containing the application state. Most modules and
    <TT>Command</TT> classes require an instance of the
    <TT>AppContext</TT> class. Because all state information in
    contained in an <TT>AppContext</TT> instance, multiple instances
    of Antidote can run inside the same JVM as long as each has it's
    own <TT>AppContext</TT>. (Interestingly, two instances of the
    Antidote could conceivably share an <TT>AppContext</TT> instance
    through RMI, allowing remote interaction/collaboration.)</P>

    <H2>Configuration and ResourceManager</H2>
    
    <P>Full "i18n" support should be assumed in modern applications,
    and all user viewable strings should be defined in a configuration
    file. For Antidote this configuraiton file is
    <TT>antidote.properties</TT>, which is located (with other UI
    resources) in the subpackage "resources".</P>

    <P>To aid in the lookup of text properties, as well as other
    resources like icons, a class called <TT>ResourceManager</TT> is
    defined. There are various convenience methods attached to this
    class, which will likely grow to make looking up configuration
    values as easy as possible.</P>

    <P>The organization of configuration properties is based on the
    fully qualifed path of the class that requires the property. For
    example, the "about" box contains a messages, so it looks for the
    property "<TT>org.apache.tools.ant.gui.About.message</TT>" for the text
    message it should display. Therefore, the <TT>ResourceManager</TT>
    method <TT>getString()</TT> takes a <TT>Class</TT> instance as
    well as a <TT>String</TT> key. Please see the
    <TT>ResourceManager</TT> documentation for more information. Given
    this support, no user visible strings should appear in the source
    code itself.</P>
