<h1>Running Ant</h1>
<h2><a name="commandline">Command Line</a></h2>
<p> If you've installed Ant as described in the
<a href="install.html"> Installing Ant</a> section,
running Ant from the command-line is simple: just type
<code>ant</code>.</p>
<p>When no arguments are specified, Ant looks for a <code>build.xml</code>
file in the current directory and, if found, uses that file as the
build file and runs the target specified in the <code>default</code>
attribute of the <code>&lt;project&gt;</code> tag.
To make Ant use
a build file other than <code>build.xml</code>, use the command-line
option <nobr><code>-buildfile <i>file</i></code></nobr>,
where <i>file</i> is the name of the build file you want to use.</p>
If you use the <nobr><code>-find [<i>file</i>]</code></nobr> option,
Ant will search for a build file first in the current directory, then in
the parent directory, and so on, until either a build file is found or the root
of the filesystem has been reached. By default, it will look for a build file
called <code>build.xml</code>. To have it search for a build file other
than <code>build.xml</code>, specify a file argument.
<strong>Note:</strong> If you include any other flags or arguments
on the command line after
the <nobr><code>-find</code></nobr> flag, you must include the file argument
for the <nobr><code>-find</code></nobr> flag, even if the name of the
build file you want to find is <code>build.xml</code>.

<p>You can also set <a href="using.html#properties">properties</a> on the
command line.  This can be done with
the <nobr><code>-D<i>property</i>=<i>value</i></code></nobr> option,
where <i>property</i> is the name of the property,
and <i>value</i> is the value for that property. If you specify a
property that is also set in the build file
(see the <a href="CoreTasks/property.html">property</a> task),
the value specified on the
command line will override the value specified in the
build file.
Defining properties on the command line can also be used to pass in
the value of environment variables - just pass
<nobr><code>-DMYVAR=%MYVAR%</code></nobr> (Windows) or
<nobr><code>-DMYVAR=$MYVAR</code></nobr> (Unix)
to Ant. You can then access
these variables inside your build file as <code>${MYVAR}</code>.
You can also access environment variables using the
<a href="CoreTasks/property.html"> property</a> task's
<code>environment</code> attribute.
</p>

<p>Options that affect the amount of logging output by Ant are:
<nobr><code>-quiet</code></nobr>,
which instructs Ant to print less
information to the console;
<nobr><code>-verbose</code></nobr>, which causes Ant to print
additional information to the console; and <nobr><code>-debug</code></nobr>,
which causes Ant to print considerably more additional information.
</p>

<p>It is also possible to specify one or more targets that should be executed.
When omitted, the target that is specified in the
<code>default</code> attribute of the
<a href="using.html#projects"><code>project</code></a> tag is
used.</p>

<p>The <nobr><code>-projecthelp</code></nobr> option prints out a list
of the build file's targets. Targets that include a
<code>description</code> attribute are listed as &quot;Main targets&quot;,
those without a <code>description</code> are listed as
&quot;Subtargets&quot;, then the &quot;Default&quot; target is listed.

<h3><a name="options">Command-line Options Summary</a></h3>

  -diagnostics           print information that might be helpful to
                         diagnose or report problems.
  -quiet, -q             be extra quiet

  -inputhandler &lt;class&gt;  the class which will handle input requests
  -find &lt;file&gt;           search for buildfile towards the root of the

<h3>Examples</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>runs Ant using the <code>build.xml</code> file in the current directory, on
the default target.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant -buildfile test.xml</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>runs Ant using the <code>test.xml</code> file in the current directory, on
the default target.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant -buildfile test.xml dist</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>runs Ant using the <code>test.xml</code> file in the current directory, on
the target called <code>dist</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ant -buildfile test.xml -Dbuild=build/classes dist</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>runs Ant using the <code>test.xml</code> file in the current directory, on
the target called <code>dist</code>, setting the <code>build</code> property
to the value <code>build/classes</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="files">Files</a></h3>

<p>The Ant wrapper script for Unix will source (read and evaluate) the
file <code>~/.antrc</code> before it does anything. On Windows, the Ant
wrapper batch-file invokes <code>%HOME%\antrc_pre.bat</code> at the start and
<code>%HOME%\antrc_post.bat</code> at the end.  You can use these
files, for example, to set/unset environment variables that should only be
visible during the execution of Ant.  See the next section for examples.</p>

<h3><a name="envvars">Environment Variables</a></h3>

<p>The wrapper scripts use the following environment variables (if
set):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>JAVACMD</code> - full path of the Java executable.  Use this
  to invoke a different JVM than <code>JAVA_HOME/bin/java(.exe)</code>.</li>

  <li><code>ANT_OPTS</code> - command-line arguments that should be
  passed to the JVM. For example, you can define system properties or set
  the maximum Java heap size here.</li>

  <li><code>ANT_ARGS</code> - Ant command-line arguments. For example,
  set <code>ANT_ARGS</code> to point to a different logger, include a
  listener, and to include the <code>-find</code> flag.</li>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If you include <code>-find</code>
  in <code>ANT_ARGS</code>, you should include the name of the build file
  to find, even if the file is called <code>build.xml</code>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="cygwin">Cygwin Users</a></h2>
<p>The Unix launch script that come with Ant works correctly with Cygwin. You 
should not have any problems launching Ant form the Cygwin shell. It is important 
to note however, that once Ant is runing it is part of the JDK which operates as
a native Windows application. The JDK is not a Cygwin executable, and it therefore 
has no knowledge of the Cygwin paths, etc. In particular when using the &lt;exec&gt;
task, executable names such as &quot;/bin/sh&quot; will not work, even though these 
work from the Cygwin shell from which Ant was launched. You can use an executable 
name such as &quot;sh&quot; and rely on that command being available in the Windows
path.
</p>

<h2><a name="viajava">Running Ant via Java</a></h2>
<p>If you have installed Ant in the do-it-yourself way, Ant can be started
with:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>java -Dant.home=c:\ant org.apache.tools.ant.Main [options] [target]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions actually do exactly the same as the <code>ant</code>
command. The options and target are the same as when running Ant with the <code>ant</code>
command. This example assumes you have set your classpath to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ant.jar</code></li>
<li>jars/classes for your XML parser</li>
<li>the JDK's required jar/zip files</li>
</ul>
