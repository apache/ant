<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Ant provides a number of optional tasks for developing 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb" target="_top">Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs)</a>. 
In general these tasks are specific to the particular vendor's EJB Server. At present the tasks support
<a href="http://www.bea.com" target="_top">Weblogic</a> 4.5.1 and 5.1 EJB servers. Over time we expect further optional tasks 
to support additional EJB Servers.

<h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
<p>ddcreator will compile a set of Weblogic text-based deployment descriptors into a serialized
EJB deployment descriptor. The selection of which of the text-based descriptors are to be compiled
is based on the standard Ant include and exclude selection mechanisms.

<h2><a name="ejbc">ejbc</a></h2>
<h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
<p>The ejbc task will run Weblogic's ejbc tool. This tool will take a serialised deployment descriptor, 
examine the various EJB interfaces and bean classes and then generate the required support classes 
necessary to deploy the bean in a Weblogic EJB container. This will include the RMI stubs and skeletons
as well as the classes which implement the bean's home and remote interfaces.</p>
<p>
The ant task which runs this tool is able to compile several beans in a single operation. The beans to be 
compiled are selected by including their serialised deployment descriptors. The standard ant 
<code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> constructs can be used to select the deployment descriptors
to be included. </p>
<p>
Each descriptor is examined to determine whether the generated classes are out of date and need to be 
regenerated. The deployment descriptor is de-serialized to discover the home, remote and 
implementation classes. The corresponding source files are determined and checked to see their 
modification times. These times and the modification time of the serialised descriptor itself are
compared with the modification time of the generated classes. If the generated classes are not present
or are out of date, the ejbc tool is run to generate new versions.</p>

<h2><a name="ejbjar">ejbjar</a></h2>
<h3><b>Description:</b></h3>

<p>This task is designed to support building of EJB1.1 jar files. Support is 
currently provided for 'vanilla' EJB1.1 jar files - i.e. those containing only 
the user generated class files and the standard deployment descriptor. Nested 
elements provide support for vendor specific deployment tools. These currently
include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>an element or building Weblogic 5.1/6.0 session/entity beans using the 
      weblogic.ejbc tool.</li>
  <li>an element for building TOPLink for WebLogic 2.5.1-enabled entity beans.</li>
</ul>

<p>This task supports two approaches to creating ejb jar files. The first 
approach assumes a particular naming convention for deployment descriptor files. 
For an Account bean, for example, the deployment descriptor would be named 
<code>Account-ejb-jar.xml</code>. This naming convention allows the task to 
distinguish deployment descriptors without relying on their positioning within a 
source tree. It is also used to derive the name of the .jar file which is 
generated. For the example this would be <code>Account.jar</code>. Vendor 
specific files are assumed to be named in a similar fashion. The deployment 
descriptor file which defines additional weblogic specific information for the 
above bean would be <code>Account-weblogic-ejb-jar.xml</code>. The second 
approach does not require a naming convention. This approach uses a specified a 
jar name for the resultant ejb jar. If the jar name is present, then no naming 
convention is required. If the jar name is not specified, then the default 
naming convention is expected for the deployment descriptor files.</p>

<p>The task works as a directory scanning task, and performs an action for each 
deployment descriptor found. As such the includes and excludes should be set 
to ensure that all desired EJB1.1 descriptors are found, but no application 
server descriptors are found. For each descriptor found, ejbjar will parse the 
deployment descriptor to determine the necessary class files which implement the 
bean. These files are assembled along with the deployment descriptors into a 
well formed EJB jar file. Any support files which need to be included in the 
generated jarcan be added with the &lt;support&gt; nested element. For each 
class included in the jar, ejbjar will scan for any super classes or super
interfaces. These will be added to the generated jar.</p>

<p>If no nested vendor-specific deployment elements are present, the task will 
simply generate a generic EJB jar. Such jars are typically used as the input to 
vendor-specific deployment tools. For each nested deployment element, a vendor 
specific deployment tool is run to generate a jar file ready for deployment in 
that vendor's EJB container. </p>

<p>The jar files are only built if they are out of date.  Each deployment tool 
element will examine its target jar file and determine if it is out of date with 
respect to the class files and deployment descriptors that make up the bean. If 
any of these files are newer than the jar file the jar will be rebuilt otherwise 
a message is logged that the jar file is up to date.</p>

<h3>Nested Elements</h3>

<p>In addition to the vendor specific nested elements, the ejbjar task provides 
three nested elements. </p>

<h4>Classpath</h4>

<p>The &lt;classpath&gt; nested element allows the classpath 
to be set. It is useful when setting the classpath from a reference path. IN all 
othe rrespects the behaviour is the same as the classpath attribute.</p>

<h4>dtd</h4>

<p>The &lt;dtd&gt; element is used to specify the local location of DTDs to be 
used when parsing the EJB deployment descriptor. Using a local DTD is much 
faster than loading the DTD across the net. If you are running ejbjar behind a 
firewall you may not even be able to access the remote DTD. The supported 
vendor-specific nested elements know the location of the required DTDs within 
the vendor class hierarchy and, in general, this means &lt;dtd&gt; elements are 
not required. It does mean, however, that the vendor's class hierarchy must be 
available in the classpath when Ant is started. If your want to run Ant without 
requiring the vendor classes in the classpath, you would need to use a 
&lt;dtd&gt; element.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">publicId</td>
    <td valign="top">The public Id of the DTD for which the location is being provided</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">location</td>
    <td valign="top">The location of the local copy of the DTD. This can either be a
                     file or a resource loadable from the classpath.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>support</h4>

<p>The &lt;support&gt; nested element is used to supply additional classes 
(files) to be included in the generated jars. The &lt;support&gt; element is a 
FileSet, so it can either reference a fileset declared elsewehere or it can be 
defined in-place with the approrpiate &lt;include&gt; and &lt;exclude&gt; nested 
elements. The files in the support fileset are added into the generated EJB jar 
in the same relative location as their location within the support fileset. Note 
that when ejbjar generates more than one jar file, the support files are added 
to each one.</p>

<h3>Vendor-specific deployment elements</h3>

Each vendor-specific nested element controls the generation of a deployable jar 
specific to that vendor's EJB container. The parameters for each supported 
deployment element are detailed here.

<h3>Weblogic element</h3>

<p>The weblogic element is used to control the weblogic.ejbc compiler for 
generating weblogic EJB jars. Prior to Ant 1.3, the method of locating CMP 
descriptors was to use the ejbjar naming convention. So if your ejb-jar was 
called, Customer-ejb-jar.xml, your weblogic descriptor was called Customer-
weblogic-ejb-jar.xml and your CMP descriptor had to be Customer-weblogic-cmp-
rdbms-jar.xml. In addition, the &lt;type-storage&gt; element in the weblogic 
descriptor had to be set to the standard name META-INF/weblogic-cmp-rdbms-
jar.xml, as that is where the CMP descriptor was mapped to in the generated 
jar.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with this scheme. It does not allow for more than 
one CMP descriptor to be defined in a jar and it is not compatible with the 
deployment descriptors generated by some tools.</p>

<p>In Ant 1.3, ejbjar parses the weblogic deployment descriptor to discover the 
CMP descriptors, which are then included automatically. This behaviour is 
controlled by the newCMP attribute. Note that if you move to the new method of 
determining CMP descriptors, you will need to update your weblogic deployment 
descriptor's &lt;type-storage&gt; element. In the above example, you would 
define this as META-INF/Customer-weblogic-cmp-rdbms-jar.xml.</p>

<p>The weblogic nested element itself supports two nested elements &lt;classpath&gt; and 
&lt;wlclasspath&gt; which are used to set the respective classpaths. These nested elements
are useful when setting up class paths using reference Ids.</p>

<h3>TOPLink for Weblogic element</h3>

<p>The TopLink element is used to handle beans which use Toplink for the CMP operations. It
is derived from the standard weblogic element so it supports the same set of attributes please these
additional attributes</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>This example shows ejbjar being used to generate deployment jars using a 
Weblogic EJB container. This example requires the naming standard to be used for 
the deployment descriptors. Using this format will create a ejb jar file for 
each variation of '*-ejb-jar.xml' that is found in the deployment descriptor 
directory.</p>

<pre>
    &lt;ejbjar srcdir=&quot;${build.classes}&quot;
            descriptordir=&quot;${descriptor.dir}&quot;&gt;
      &lt;weblogic destdir=&quot;${deploymentjars.dir}&quot;
                classpath=&quot;${descriptorbuild.classpath}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;include name=&quot;**/*-ejb-jar.xml&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*weblogic*.xml&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/ejbjar&gt;
</pre>

<p>If weblogic is not in the Ant classpath, the following example 
shows how to specify the location of the weblogic DTDs. This 
example also show the use of a nested classpath element.</p>
   
<pre>
    &lt;ejbjar descriptordir=&quot;${src.dir}&quot; srcdir=&quot;${build.classes}&quot;&gt;
       &lt;weblogic destdir=&quot;${deployment.webshop.dir}&quot; 
                 keepgeneric=&quot;true&quot;
                 args=&quot;-g -keepgenerated ${ejbc.compiler}&quot;
                 suffix=&quot;.jar&quot;
                 oldCMP=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
         &lt;classpath&gt;
           &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${descriptorbuild.classpath}&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/classpath&gt;
       &lt;/weblogic&gt;
       &lt;include name=&quot;**/*-ejb-jar.xml&quot;/&gt; 
       &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*-weblogic-ejb-jar.xml&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;dtd publicId=&quot;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Enterprise JavaBeans 1.1//EN&quot;
            location=&quot;${weblogic.home}/classes/weblogic/ejb/deployment/xml/ejb-jar.dtd&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;dtd publicId=&quot;-//BEA Systems, Inc.//DTD WebLogic 5.1.0 EJB//EN&quot;
            location=&quot;${weblogic.home}/classes/weblogic/ejb/deployment/xml/weblogic-ejb-jar.dtd&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/ejbjar&gt;
</pre>   


<p>This example shows ejbjar being used to generate a single deployment jar 
using a Weblogic EJB container. This example does not require the deployment 
descriptors to use the naming standard. This will create only one ejb jar file -
'TheEJBJar.jar'.</p>


<pre>
    &lt;ejbjar srcdir=&quot;${build.classes}&quot;
            descriptordir=&quot;${descriptor.dir}&quot;
            basejarname=&quot;TheEJBJar&quot;&gt;
      &lt;weblogic destdir=&quot;${deploymentjars.dir}&quot;
                classpath=&quot;${descriptorbuild.classpath}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;include name=&quot;**/ejb-jar.xml&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/weblogic*.xml&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/ejbjar&gt;
</pre>

<p>This example shows ejbjar being used to generate deployment jars for a TOPLink-enabled entity bean using a 
Weblogic EJB container. This example does not require the deployment descriptors to use the naming standard.
This will create only one TOPLink-enabled ejb jar file - 'Address.jar'.</p>

<pre>
    &lt;ejbjar srcdir=&quot;${build.dir}&quot;
            destdir=&quot;${solant.ejb.dir}&quot;
            descriptordir=&quot;${descriptor.dir}&quot;
            basejarname=&quot;Address&quot;&gt;
            &lt;weblogictoplink destdir=&quot;${solant.ejb.dir}&quot;
                    classpath=&quot;${java.class.path}&quot;
                    keepgeneric=&quot;false&quot;
                    toplinkdescriptor=&quot;Address.xml&quot;
                    toplinkdtd=&quot;file:///dtdfiles/toplink-cmp_2_5_1.dtd&quot;
                    suffix=&quot;.jar&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;include name=&quot;**/ejb-jar.xml&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/weblogic-ejb-jar.xml&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/ejbjar&gt;
</pre>

<p>This final example shows how you would set-up ejbjar under Weblogic 6.0. It also shows the use of the 
&lt;support&gt; element to add support files

<pre>
    &lt;ejbjar descriptordir=&quot;${dd.dir}&quot; srcdir=&quot;${build.classes.server}&quot;&gt;
       &lt;include name=&quot;**/*-ejb-jar.xml&quot;/&gt; 
       &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*-weblogic-ejb-jar.xml&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;support dir=&quot;${build.classes.server}&quot;&gt;
            &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.class&quot;/&gt; 
       &lt;/support&gt;
       &lt;weblogic destdir=&quot;${deployment.dir}&quot; 
                 keepgeneric=&quot;true&quot;
                 suffix=&quot;.jar&quot;
                 rebuild=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
         &lt;classpath&gt;
            &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${build.classes.server}&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/classpath&gt;
         &lt;wlclasspath&gt;
            &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${weblogic.classes}&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/wlclasspath&gt;
       &lt;/weblogic&gt;
    &lt;/ejbjar&gt;
</pre>
