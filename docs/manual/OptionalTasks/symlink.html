<h2><a name="symlink">Symlink</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p> Manages symbolic links on Unix based platforms. Can be used to
make an individual link, delete a link, create multiple links from properties files, 
or create properties files describing links in the specified directories.
Existing links are not overwritten by default.

<p><a href="../CoreTypes/fileset.html">FileSet</a>s are used to select a
set of links to record, or a set of property files to create links from. </p>

<h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>
 
<h4>fileset</h4>
 <p><a href="../CoreTypes/fileset.html">FileSet</a>s
 are used when action = "record" to select directories and linknames to be recorded. 
 They are also used when action = "recreate" to specify both the name of the property 
 files to be processed, and the directories in which they can be found. At least one 
 fileset is required for each case.</p>
 
<h3>Examples</h3>

  <p> Make a link named "foo" to a resource named "bar.foo" in subdir:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;symlink link="${dir.top}/foo" resource="${dir.top}/subdir/bar.foo"/&gt;
  </pre>
 
  <p> Record all links in subdir and it's descendants in files named
  "dir.links"</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;symlink action="record" linkfilename="dir.links"&gt;
     &lt;fileset dir="${dir.top}" includes="subdir&#47;**"/&gt;
  &lt;/symlink&gt;
  </pre>
 
  <p> Recreate the links recorded in the previous example:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;symlink action="recreate"&gt;
     &lt;fileset dir="${dir.top}" includes="subdir&#47;**&#47;dir.links"/&gt;  
  &lt;/symlink&gt;
  </pre>
 
 <p> Delete a link named "foo":
 <pre>
 &lt;symlink action="delete" link="${dir.top}/foo"/&gt;
 </pre>

  <p><strong>Java 1.2 and earlier:</strong> Due to limitations on executing system
  level commands in Java versions earlier than 1.3 this task may have difficulty
  operating with a relative path in ANT_HOME. The typical symptom is an 
  IOException where ant can't find /some/working/directory${ANT_HOME}/bin/antRun
  or something similar. The workaround is to change your ANT_HOME environment
  variable to an absolute path, which will remove the /some/working/directory portion
  of the above path and allow ant to find the correct commandline execution script.
 
  <p><strong>LIMITATIONS:</strong> Because Java has no direct support for
  handling symlinks this task divines them by comparing canonical and
  absolute paths. On non-unix systems this may cause false positives.
  Furthermore, any operating system on which the command
  <code>ln -s &lt;linkname&gt; &lt;resourcename&gt;</code> is not a valid 
  command on the command line will not be able to use action="single" or 
  action="recreate". Action="record" and action=delete should still work. Finally, 
  the lack of support for symlinks in Java means that all links are recorded as 
  links to the <strong>canonical</strong> resource name. Therefore the link:
  <code>link --> subdir/dir/../foo.bar</code> will be recorded as
  <code>link=subdir/foo.bar</code> and restored as
  <code>link --> subdir/foo.bar</code></p>
