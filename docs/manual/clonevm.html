<h2><a name="clonevm">build.clonevm</a></h2>

<p><em>Since Ant 1.7</em></p>

<p>The value of the build.clonevm system property controls how Ant
instruments forked Java Virtual Machines.  The <a
href="CoreTasks/java.html">java</a> and <a
href="OptionalTasks/junit.html">junit</a> tasks support clonevm
attributes to control the VMs on a task-by-task basis while the system
property applies to all forked Java VMs.</p>

<p>If the value of the property is true, then all system properties of
the forked Java Virtual Machine will be the same as those of the Java
VM running Ant.  In addition, if you set build.clonevm to true and <a
href="sysclasspath.html">build.sysclasspath</a> has not been set, the
bootclasspath of forked Java VMs gets constructed as if
build.sysclasspath had the value "last".</p>

<p>Note that this has to be a system property, so it cannot be
specified on the Ant command line.  Use the ANT_OPTS environment
variable instead.</p>
