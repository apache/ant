             You may be able to see in this trace what ant is doing and why it takes a particular 
             course of action. If you need even more information you can use the <code>-debug</code> 
             flag rather than <code>-verbose</code>. This will generally produce so much output that 
             you may want to save the output and analyze it in an editor.
           </p>
                                <p>So, once you have all this debug information, how can you use it to solve your problem. 
              That will depend on the task in question and the nature of your problem. Each task logs
              different aspects of its operation, but it will give you an idea of what is going on. For
              example, the &lt;javac&gt; task logs the reasons why it chooses to compile particular 
              classes and the equivalent command it is using. The following trace (which has been edited
              and reformatted for clarity) shows javac adding one class but skipping another. This is followed 
              by the compiler arguments and a summary of all the classes to be compiled.

              In many cases Ant tasks are wrappers around OS commands or other java classes. In debug mode, many
              of these tasks will print out the equivalent command line, as the &lt;javac&gt; task above does. If 
              you are having a problem, it is often useful to run the command directly in the same way Ant is doing 
              and see if the problem persists. The problem may lie in the command being run by Ant, or in the way 
              the Ant task is running the command. You can also see the effect of changing attribute values on the
              generated command line. This can help you to understand whether you are using the correct attributes
              and values.

          After examining the debug output, you still believe that the problem you are having may be caused by Ant. 
          Chances are that someone else may have already encountered this problem and perhaps it has been
          fixed. The next step, therefore, may be to try a nightly build of Ant to see if the 
          problem has been fixed. Nightly builds for Ant are available from the 
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/jakarta/jakarta-ant/nightly/">Jakarta web site</a>. While Ant nightly
          builds are typically quite stable and are used by <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/jakarta/gump/latest/">
          Gump</a> to build many other Jakarta projects, these builds should be treated as experimental. You can 
          install and verify whether your problem has been fixed. Note that nightly builds do not build many of the
          optional tasks the come with Ant. A snapshot of these optional tasks is occasionally uploaded to the nightly 
          download <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/jakarta/jakarta-ant/nightly/optional/">area</a>. Note that even 
          this snapshot does not contain every optional task.

          If the current nightly build doesn't resolve your problem, it is possible that someone else has reported
          the issue. It is time to look at the <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/">Apache Bug Database</a>.
          This system is easy to use and it will let you search the currently open and resolved bugs to see if your
          problem has already been reported. If it has, you can see whether any of the developers have commented, 
          suggesting workarounds or the reason for the bug, etc. You may have more information to add (see about 
          creating bug reports below), in which case, go right ahead and add it. If you can't add more information
          you may just want to vote for this bug, and perhaps add yourself to the CC list to follow the progress of
          this bug.

                        <p>By this time you may have decided that there is a bug in Ant. You have a few choices at this 
           point. You can send an email to the ant-user mailing list to see if others have encountered your issue
           and how they may have worked around it. If after some discussion, you still feel you have a bug, it 
           is time to create a bug report. This is a simple operation in the Bug Database. Please try to provide 
           as much information as possible to assist the developers in resolving the bug. Please try to enter correct 
           values for the various inputs when creating the bug. Once the bug is created you can add attachments to
           the bug report. 
        </p>
                                <p>What information should you include in your bug report? The easiest bugs to fix are those which are most 
           easily reproducible, so if you can, it is really helpful to produce a small test case that exhibits the
           problem. In this case, you would attach the build file and other files necessary to reproduce the problem
           probably packed together in an archive. If you can't produce a test case, you should try to include a 
           snippet from your build file and the relevant sections from the debug out from Ant. Try to include the 
           header information where Ant states the version, the OS and VM information etc. As the debug output is 
           likely to be very large, you should try to remove the output which is not relevant. Once the bug is 
           entered into the Bug Database, you will be kept informed about progress on the bug. If you receive email
           asking for further information, please try to respond as it will aid in the resolution of your bug.
