 * Utility class to contain version numbers in "Dewey Decimal"

 * represent major, minor, micro, etc versions.  The version number
 * must begin with a number.

 * Original Implementation moved to org.apache.tools.ant.util.DeweyDecimal
 * @deprecated use org.apache.tools.ant.util.DeweyDecimal instead.
 * Deprecated since ant 1.8
