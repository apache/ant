/**
 * Plays a sound file at the end of the build, according to whether the build failed or succeeded.
 *
 * There are three attributes to be set:
 *
 * <code>source</code>: the location of the audio file to be played
 * <code>duration</code>: play the sound file continuously until "duration" milliseconds has expired
 * <code>loops</code>: the number of times the sound file should be played until stopped
 *
 * I have only tested this with .WAV and .AIFF sound file formats. Both seem
 * to work fine.
 *
 * plans for the future:
 * - use the midi api to define sounds (or drum beat etc) in xml and have
 *   Ant play them back
