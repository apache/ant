/**
 * Task to provide functional testing under Ant, with a fairly complex workflow of:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Conditional execution</li>
 * <li>Application to start</li>
 * <li>A probe to "waitfor" before running tests</li>
 * <li>A tests sequence</li>
 * <li>A reporting sequence that runs after the tests have finished</li>
 * <li>A "teardown" clause that runs after the rest.</li>
 * <li>Automated termination of the program it executes, if a timeout is not met</li>
 * <li>Checking of a failure property and automatic raising of a fault
 *     (with the text in failureText)
 * if test shutdown and reporting succeeded</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 * The task is designed to be framework neutral; it will work with JUnit,
 *  TestNG and other test frameworks That can be
 * executed from Ant. It bears a resemblance to the FunctionalTest task from
 * SmartFrog, as the attribute names were
 * chosen to make migration easier. However, this task benefits from the
 * ability to tweak Ant's internals, and so
 * simplify the workflow, and from the experience of using the SmartFrog task.
 * No code has been shared.
 *
 * @since Ant 1.8
