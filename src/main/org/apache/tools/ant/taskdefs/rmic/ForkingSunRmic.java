 * This is an extension of the sun rmic compiler, which forks rather than
 * executes it inline. Why so? Because rmic is dog slow, but if you fork the
 * compiler you can have multiple copies compiling different bits of your project
 * at the same time. Which, on a multi-cpu system results in significant speedups.
 *
 * Also, Java1.6 behaves oddly with -XNew, so we switch it on here if needed.
