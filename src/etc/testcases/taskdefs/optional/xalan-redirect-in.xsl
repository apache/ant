This is a test to ensure that systemid is set correctly
for a xsl...the behavior might be dependent on Xalan1
and Xalan2...this will be a problem to erase the files :(
Can take as a systemid the base for the xsl document or
the base or the JVM working dir just like: new File("xalan-redirect-out.tmp")
