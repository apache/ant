	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/command/DisplayErrorCmd.java: Added
	code to allow display of stack backtrace if needed.

2000-11-18  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/customizer/PropertiesPropertyEditor.java:
	Added proper editing capability. Rows are added and removed
	automatically. 
	
	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/customizer/XXXPropertyEditor.java:

2000-11-16  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/customizer/StringPropertyEditor.java:
	Changed underlying widget type to JTextPane so that it would
	accomidate multi-line strings property.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/acs/ACSTreeNodeElement.java: Fixed
	nasty java.lang.IllegalAccessException bug that I thought was
	related to Java 1.3 Blackdown RC1, but wasn't. It was related to
	using Jikes, which interprests method resolution differently than
	javac, resulting in a call trying to access a private method
	implementation of a public interface.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ResourceManager.java: Added convenience
	method for getting resource images for a given class.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/AntAction.java: Added toggle property.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ActionManager.java: Added ability to
	handle toggle actions to menu bar (still need to add support to
	tool bar).

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/EventResponder.java: Added emacs
	notifier command.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ide/EmacsNotifier.java: Imported.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Added code to add
	listeners registered with the AppContext to the build.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/AppContext.java: Now allows registering
	of build listeners to be added to project at build time.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Main.java: Added loading of build file
	provided on command line.

2000-11-14  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Antidote.java: Added top area widget,
	which is *not* managed inside a split pane.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectNavigator.java: Added minimum
	size to keep resizing of parent from hiding widget.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ActionManager.java: Large functionality
	addtion for allowing action enabled/disabled state to be defined
	in the configuration file. The triggering of state changes is
	based on the firing of specific events.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/AntAction.java: Broke out from inner
	class of ActionManager to its own self (I'm my own man!).

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/command/CloseCmd.java: Added firing of
	ProjectClosedEvent so state updates could occur.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/resources/action.properties: Added
	enabledOn and disabledOn event specifications.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Console.java: Improved reporting level
	handling (some events weren't getting reported).

2000-11-10  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/PropertyEditor.java: Added new
	DynamicCustomizer class instead of HTML based info.

2000-11-09  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Started rework of
	project data model, using elements from the XML parser directly
	through the new Ant Construction Set package.

2000-11-08  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/About.java: Useless tweaking inspired
	by procrastination.

2000-11-05  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/LogLevelEnum.java: Added log level
	enumeration for use with combo boxes (drops nicely into default model).

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/event/BuildEventType.java: Added
	delivering of event to a BuildListener based on enumeration value.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Added generation of
	BuildEvent on project start and finish, as the project itself
	doesn't generate theses events (unfortunately).

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Console.java: Added filtering level,
	and clearing of buffer when a new build starts.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/AntEditor.java: Added automatic border
	for all subclasses.

2000-11-04  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Added inner class to
	execute the build in a separate thread.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/event/EventBus.java: Added check to see
	if postEvent() is being called on the AWTEvent thread, and if not,
	post the dispatching of the event to that thread. This is needed
	as most of the listeners will be bound to GUI components and will
	be updating their state (which must occur on the event thread).

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Added a
	BuildListener to forward events to the EventBus.

2000-11-03  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Antidote.java: Removed hard-coded
	Console class.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Console.java: Changed to a real
	AntEditor class, initialized by the config file.

2000-11-02  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/event/EventBus.java: Added interrupt
	level support.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/About.java: Created
	
2000-11-01  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Main.java: Added XMLHelper.init() call
	
	* build.xml: Updated run target to include ant.jar in classpath.
