dotnet sandbox README

Goal:
-----

Provide a simple infrastructure to execute .NET applications from
within Ant for different VMs so that the user doesn't have to change
the build file when she wants to run Mono on Linux and Microsoft's VM
on Windows.

This sounds far more ambitioned than it actually is.

Short term goals are:

* A <dotnetexec> task that can be used as

  <dotnetexec executable="ExampleCsc.exe"/>

  without testing for the environment (see the dotnet.xml build file
  for Ant's tests as an example for what may become simpler with
  this).

* A <nant> task.

* A <msbuild> task - if only for the fun of having it.

* A <wix> task.

* A <nunit> task.

Those tasks should end up in an antlib of their own in order to be
distributable independent of Ant.
